c - crash     b - bug fix    e - enhancement    f - new feature  n - note

3.0
  e - make node functionality multi-threaded. Data is now protected, and 
      TORQUE can run with a customizable amount of threads available in the
      threadpool using min_threads, max_threads, and thread_idle_seconds.
      Only available when configured with --enable-pthreads

2.6.0
# note for developers: the intermediate prelease fixes are here only because
# there are users using the snapshots now. These will be removed pre-release
  b - Fixed duplicate entry in /doc/Makefile.am which caused make 
      install claiming it could not overwrite man7/pbs_resources_irix5.7 
  e - Addeded autogen.sh go make life easier in a post Makefile.in
      less world.
  c - Avoid using uninitialized resources when configured with 
      --enable-numa-support
  e - Modified buildutils/pbs_mkdirs.in to create server_priv/nodes file
      at install time. The file only shows examples and a link to the
      TORQUE documentation.
  c - do not attempt to add numa nodes to non-numa nodes
  b - fix bug in qdel - was reporting "cannot contact node" for live nodes
  b - propagate a master node's properties to its numa nodes
  b - for NUMA, removing code to report ncpus, loadave, and netload, since
      these cannot be discovered on a per "numa node" basis due to hardware
      limitations
  c - addresses are now propagated to numa nodes
  b - correct the hostnames $PBS_NODEFILE
  b - mark the numa nodes as down if the host node goes down 
  b - fix the pbsnodes :prop functionality for numa nodes
  b - make sure the node file is updated correctly when torque updates it
  b - make the tm interface work when running as a single mom
  b - have pbs_track add the new executable to the cpuset when cpusets
      are enabled
  b - only clear the mom state when actually running the 
      health check script
  e - get_hostaddr now more robust when checking if a node is numa or not
  b - corrected pbs_track error messages 
  b - correct a ports error that prevented pbsdsh/tm from working among
      normal nodes
  b - don't try to set the user id multiple times
  e - No need to configure the server with --enable-numa-support, just make
      the server flexible
  c - fix segfault in tracejob. It wasn't malloc'ing space for the null 
      terminator
  f - added ATTR_node_exclusive to allow a job to have a node exclusively. 
  f - for NUMA added extra protocol to use get_weighted_memory_size() and 
      kill jobs that exceed their memory limits
  e - if different mom ports are configured for the main node, pass it down
      to its numa nodes
  e - when ATTR_node_exclusive is set, reserve the entire node (or entire
      numa node if applicable) in the cpuset 
  n - Changed the protocol versions for all client-to-server, mom-to-server and
      mom-to-mom protocols from 1 to 2. The changes to the protocol in this version
      of TORQUE will make it incompatible with previous versions.
  e - when a select statement is used, tally up the memory requests and mark
      the total in the resource list. This allows memory enforcement for
      NUMA jobs, but doesn't affect others as memory isn't enforced for 
      multinode jobs
  e - add an asynchronous option to qdel 
  b - do not reply when an asynchronous reply has already been sent
  
2.5.4
  f - added the ability to track gpus. Users set gpus=X in the nodes file for
      relevant node, and then request gpus in the nodes request: 
      -l nodes=X[:ppn=Y][:gpus=Z]. The gpus appear in $PBS_GPUFILE, a new 
      environment variable, in the form: <hostname>-gpu<index> and in a 
      new job attribute exec_gpus: 
      <hostname>-gpu/<index>[+<hostname>-gpu/<index>...]
  b - clean up job mom checkpoint directory on checkpoint failure
  e - Bugzilla bug 91. Check the status before the service is actually started.
      (Steve Traylen - CERN)
  e - Bugzilla bug 89. Only touch lock/subsys files if service actually starts.
      (Steve Traylen - CERN)

2.5.3
  b - stop reporting errors on success when modifying array ranges
  b - don't try to set the user id multiple times
  b - added some retrying to get connection and changed some log messages when
      doing a pbs_alterjob after a checkpoint
  c - fix segfault in tracejob. It wasn't malloc'ing space for the null 
      terminator
  e - add the variables PBS_NUM_NODES and PBS_NUM_PPN to the job environment
      (TRQ-6)
  e - be able to append to the job's variable_list through the API 
      (TRQ-5)
  e - Added support for munge authentication. This is an alternative for the 
      default ruserok remote authentication and pbs_iff. This is a compile
      time option. The configure option to use is --enable-munge-auth.
      Ken Nielson (TRQ-7) September 15, 2010.
  b - fix the dependency hold for arrays. They were accidentally cleared 
      before (RT 8593)
  e - add a logging statement if sendto fails at any points in rpp_send_out
  b - Applied patch submitted by Will Nolan to fix bug 76. 
      "blocking read does not time out using signal handler"
  b - fix a bug in the $spool_as_final_name code if HAVE_WORDEXP is 
      undefined
  b - Bugzilla bug 84. Security bug on the way checkpoint is being handled.
      (Robin R. - Miami Univ. of Ohio)
  e - Now saving serverdb as an xml file instead of a byte-dump, thus 
      allowing canned installations without qmgr scripts, as well as more
      portability. Able to upgrade automatically from 2.1, 2.3, and 2.4
  b - fix to cleanup job files on mom after a BLCR job is checkpointed and held
  b - make the tcp reading buffer able to grow dynamically to read larger 
      values in order to avoid "invalid protocol" messages 
  e - change so checkpoint files are transfered as the user, not as root.
  f - Added configure option --with-servchkptdir which allows specifying path
      for server's checkpoint files
  b - could not set the server HA parameters lock_file_update_time and 
      lock_file_check_time previously. Fixed.
  e - qpeek now has the options --ssh, --rsh, --spool, --host, -o, and 
      -e. Can now output both the STDOUT and STDERR files.  Eliminated 
      numlines, which didn't work.
  b - fix to prevent a possible segfault when using checkpointing.

2.5.2
  e - Allow the nodes file to use the syntax node[0-100] in the name to 
      create identical nodes with names node0, node1, ..., node100.
      (also node[000-100] => node000, node001, ... node100)
  b - fix support of the 'procs' functionality for qsub.
  b - remove square brackets [] from job and default stdout/stderr filenames 
      for job arrays (fixes conflict with some non-bash shells)
  n - fix build system so README.array_changes is included in tar.gz file made
      with "make dist"
  n - fix build system so contrib/pbsweb-lite-0.95.tar.gz, contrib/qpool.gz
      and contrib/README.pbstools are included the the tar.gz file made
      with "make dist"
  c - fixed crash when moving the job to a different queue (bugzilla 73)
  e - Modified buildutils/pbs_mkdirs.in to create server_priv/nodes file
      at install time. The file only shows examples and a link to the
      TORQUE documentation. This enhancement was first committed to trunk.
  c - fix pbs_server crash from invalid qsub -t argument
  b - fix so blcr checkpoint jobs work correctly when put on hold
  b - fixed bugzilla #75 where pbs_server would segfault with a double free when
      calling qalter on a running job or job array.
  e - Changed free_br back to its original form and modifed copy_batchrequest
      to make a copy of the rq_extend element which will be freed in 
      free_br.
  b - fix condition where job array "template" may not get cleaned up properly 
      after a server restart
  b - fix to get new pagg ID and add additional CSA records when restarting from
      checkpoint
  e - added documentation for pbs_alterjob_async(), pbs_checkpointjob(),
      pbs_fbserver(), pbs_get_server_list() and pbs_sigjobasync().
  b - Commited patch from Eygene Ryanbinkin to fix bug 61. /dev/null would
      under some circumstances have its permissions modified when jobs exited
      on a compute node.
  e - add --enable-top-tempdir-only to only create the top directory of the 
      job's temporary directory when configured
  b - make the code for reconnecting to the server more robust, and remove
      elements of not connecting if a job isn't running
  e - allow input of walltime in the format of [DD]:HH:MM:SS
  b - Fix so BLCR checkpoint files get copied to server on qchkpt and periodic
      checkpoints
  c - corrected a segfault when display_job_server_suffix is set to false
      and job_suffix_alias was unset.

2.5.1
  b - modified Makefile.in and Makefile.am at root to include contrib/AddPrivileges

2.5.0

  e - Added new server config option alias_server_name. This option allows
      the MOM to add an additional server name to be added to the list
      of trusted addresses. The point of this is to be able to handle
      alias ip addresses. UDP requests that come into an aliased ip address
      are returned through the primary ip address in TORQUE. Because
      the address of the reply packet from the server is not the same address
      the MOM sent its HELLO1 request, the MOM drops the packet and the MOM
      cannot be added to the server.
  n - auto_node_np will now adjust np values down as well as up.
  e - Enabled TORQUE to be able to parse the -l procs=x node spec. Previously
      TORQUE simply recored the value of x for procs in Resources_List. It
      now takes that value and allocates x processors packed on any available 
      node. (Ken Nielson Adaptive Computing. June 17, 2010)
  f - added full support (server-scheduler-mom) for Cygwin (UIIP NAS of Belarus,
      uiip.bas-net.by)
  b - fixed EINPROGRESS in net_client.c. This signal appears every time of 
      connecting and requires individual processing. The old erroneous 
      processing brought a large network delay, especially on Cygwin.
  e - improved signal processing after connecting in client_to_svr and added own
      implementation of bindresvport for OS which lack it (Igor Ilyenko, 
      UIIP Minsk)
  f - created permission checking of Windows (Cygwin) users, using mkpasswd, 
      mkgroup and own functions IamRoot, IamUser (Yauheni Charniauski, 
      UIIP Minsk)
  f - created permission checking of submitted jobs (Vikentsi Lapa, 
      UIIP Minsk)
  f - Added the --disable-daemons configure option for start server-sched-mom
      as Windows services, cygrunsrv.exe goes its into background 
      independently.
  e - Adapted output of Cygwin's diagnostic information (Yauheni 
      Charniauski, UIIP Minsk)
  b - Changed pbsd_main to call daemonize_server early only if 
      high_availability_mode is set.
  e - added new qmgr server attributes (clone_batch_size, clone_batch_delay)
      for controlling job cloning (Bugzilla #4)
  e - added new qmgr attribute (checkpoint_defaults) for setting default
      checkpoint values on Execution queues (Bugzilla #1)
  e - print a more informative error if pbs_iff isn't found when trying to
      authenticate a client
  e - added qmgr server attribute job_start_timeout, specifies timeout to be
      used for sending job to mom. If not set, tcp_timeout is used.
  e - added -DUSESAVEDRESOURCES code that uses servers saved resources used
      for accounting end record instead of current resources used for jobs that
      stopped running while mom was not up.
  e - TORQUE job arrays now use arrays to hold the job pointers and not 
      linked lists (allows constant lookup). 
  f - Allow users to delete a range of jobs from the job array (qdel -t)
  f - Added a slot limit to the job arrays - this restricts the number of 
      jobs that can concurrently run from one job array. 
  f - added support for holding ranges of jobs from an array with a single 
      qhold (using the -t option). 
  f - now ranges of jobs in an array can be modified through qalter 
      (using the -t option). 
  f - jobs can now depend on arrays using these dependencies: 
      afterstartarray, afterokarray, afternotokarray, afteranyarray, 
  f - added support for using qrls on arrays with the -t option
  e - complte overhaul of job array submission code
  f - by default show only a single entry in qstat output for the whole array
      (qstat -t expands the job array)
  f - server parameter max_job_array_size limits the number of jobs allowed
      in an array
  b - job arrays can no longer circumvent max_user_queuable
  b - job arrays can no longer circumvent max_queuable
  f - added server parameter max_slot_limit to restrict slot limits
  e - changed array names from jobid-index to jobid[index] for consistency

2.4.11 
  b - changed type cast for calloc of ioenv from sizeof(char) to sizof(char *)
      in pbsdsh.c. This fixes bug 79.
  e - allow input of walltime in the format of [DD]:HH:MM:SS (backported from
      2.5.2)
  b - only clear the mom state when actually running the health check script
      (backported from 2.5.3)
  b - don't try to set the user id multiple times - (backported from 2.5.3)
  c - fix segfault in tracejob. It wasn't malloc'ing space for the null 
      terminator (back-ported from 2.5.3)
  e - add the variables PBS_NUM_NODES and PBS_NUM_PPN to the job environment
      (backported from 2.5.3, TRQ-6)
  e - be able to append to the job's variable_list through the API 
      (backported from 2.5.3, TRQ-5)
  b - Added patch to fix bug 76, "blocking read does not time out using 
      signal handler.
  b - Bugzilla bug 84. Security bug on the way checkpoint is being handled.
     (Robin R. - Miami Univ. of Ohio, back-ported from 2.5.3)
  b - make the tcp reading buffer able to grow dynamically to read larger 
      values in order to avoid "invalid protocol" messages (backported from
      2.5.3)
  b - could not set the server HA parameters lock_file_update_time and 
      lock_file_check_time previously. Fixed. (backported from 2.5.3)
  e - qpeek now has the options --ssh, --rsh, --spool, --host, -o, and 
      -e. Can now output both the STDOUT and STDERR files.  Eliminated 
      numlines, which didn't work. (backported from 2.5.3)
  b - Modified the pbs_server startup routine to skip unknown hosts in the 
      nodes file instead of terminating the server startup.

2.4.10
  b - fix to get new pagg ID and add additional CSA records when restarting from
      checkpoint (backported from 2.5.2)
  e - added documentation for pbs_alterjob_async(), pbs_checkpointjob(),
      pbs_fbserver(), pbs_get_server_list() and pbs_sigjobasync(). (backported 
      from 2.5.2)
  b - fix for bug 61. The fix takes care of a problem where pbs_mom under
      some situations will change the mode and permissions of /dev/null.

2.4.9
  b - Bugzilla bug 57. Check return value of malloc for tracejob for Linux
      (Chris Samuel - Univ. of Melbourne)
  b - fix so "gres" config gets displayed by pbsnodes
  b - use QSUBHOST as the default host for output files when no host is
      specified. (RT 7678) 
  e - allow users to use cpusets and geometry requests at the same time by
      specifying both at configure time.
  b - Bugzilla bug 55. Check return value of malloc for pbs_mom for Linux
      (Chris Samuel - Univ. of Melbourne)
  e - added server parameter job_force_cancel_time. When configured to X 
      seconds, a job that is still there X seconds after a qdel will be
      purged. Useful for freeing nodes from a job when one node goes down
      midjob.
  b - fixed gcc warnings reported by Skip Montanaro
  e - added RPT_BAVAIL define that allows pbs_mom to report f_bavail instead of
      f_bfree on Linux systems
  b - no longer consider -t and -T the same in qsub
  e - make PBS_O_WORKDIR accessible in the environment for prolog scripts
  e - Bugzilla 59. Applied patch to allow '=' for qdel -m.
      (Chris Samuel - Univ. of Melbourne)
  b - properly escape characters (&"'<>) in XML output)
  b - ignore port when checking host in svr_get_privilege()
  b - restore ability to parse -W x=geometry:{...,...}
  e - from Simon Toth: If no available amount is specified for a resource 
      and the max limit is set, the requirement should be checked against 
      the maximum only (for scheduler, bugzilla 23). 
  b - check return values from fwrite in cpuset.c to avoid warnings
  e - expand acl host checking to allow * in the middle of hostnames, not 
      just at the beginning. Also allow ranges like a[10-15] to mean a10,
      a11, ..., a15.

2.4.8
  e - Bugzilla bug 22. HIGH_PRECISION_FAIRSHARE for fifo scheduling.
  c - no longer sigabrt with "running" jobs not in an execution queue. log
      an error. 
  c - fixed segfault for when TORQUE thinks there's a nanny but there isn't
  e - mapped 'qsub -P user:group' to qsub -P user -W group_list=group
  b - reverted to old behavior where interactive scripts are checked for 
      directives and not run without a parameter.
  e - setting a queue's resource_max.nodes now actually restricts things,
      although so far it only limits based on the number of nodes (i.e. not
      ppn)
  f - added QSUBSENDGROUPLIST to qsub. This allows the server to know the 
      correct group name when disable_server_id_check is set to true and
      the user doesn't exist on the server.
  e - Bugzilla bug 54. Patch submitted by Bas van der Vlies to make pbs_mkdirs
      more robust, provide a help function and new option -C <chk_tree_location> 

2.4.7
  b - fixed a bug for when a resource_list has been set, but isn't completely
      initialized, causing a segfault
  b - stop counting down walltime remaining after a job is completed
  b - correctly display the number for tasks as used in TORQUE in qstat -a output
  b - no longer ignoring fread return values in linux cpuset code (gcc 4.3.3)
  b - fixed a bug where job was added to obit retry list multiple times, causing
      a segfault
  b - Fix for Bugzilla bug 43. "configure ignores with-modulefiles=no"
  b - no longer try to decide when to start with -t create in init.d scripts, 
      -t creates should be done manually by the user
  f - added -P to qsub. When submitting a job as root, the root user may add -P
      <username> to submit the job as the proxy user specified by <usermname>

2.4.6
  f - added an asynchronous option for qsig, specified with -a.
  b - fix to cleanup job that is left in running state after mom restart
  f - added two server parameters: display_job_server_suffix and job_suffix_alias.
      The first defaults to true and is whether or not jobs should be appended
      by .server_name. The second defaults to NULL, but if it is defined it
      will be appended at the end of the jobid, i.e. jobid.job_suffix_alias.
  f - added -l option to qstat so that it will display a server name and an
      alias if both are used. If these aren't used, -l has no effect.
  e - qstat -f now includes an extra field "Walltime Remaining" that tells 
      the remaining walltime in seconds. This field is does not account for
      weighted walltime.
  b - fixed open_std_file to setegid as well, this caused a problem with 
      epilogue.user scripts.
  e - qsub's -W can now parse attributes with quoted lists, for example: 
      qsub script -W attr="foo,foo1,foo2,foo3" will set foo,foo1,foo2,foo3
      as attr's value.
  b - split Cray job library and CSA functionality since CSA is dependant on job
      library but job library is not dependant on CSA

2.4.5
  b - epilogue.user scripts were being run with prologue argments. Fixed
      bug in run_pelog() to include PE_EPILOGUSER so epilogue arguments get
      passed to eplilogue.user script.
  b - Ticket 6665. pbs_mom and job recovery. Fixed a bug where the -q option 
      would terminate running processes as well as requeue jobs. This made the
      -q option the same as the -r option for pbs_mom. -q will now only reque 
      jobs and will not attempt to kill running processes. I also added a -P
      option to start pbs_mom. This is similar to the -p option except the -P
      option will only delete any left over jobs from the queue and will not
      attempt to adopt and running processes.
  e - Modified man page for pbs_mom. Added new -P option plus edited -p, -q
      and -r options to hopefully make them more understandable.
  n - 01/15/2010 created snapshot torque-2.4.5-snap201001151416.tar.gz.
  b - now checks secondary groups (as well as primary) for creating a file
      when spooling.  Before it wouldn't create the spool file if a user had 
      permission through a secondary group.
  n - 01/18/2010. Items above this point merged into trunk.
  b - fixed a file descriptor error with high availability. Before it was possible
      to try to regain a file descriptor which was never held, now this is fixed.
  b - No longer overwrites the user's environment when spoolasfinalname is set.
      Now the environment is handled correctly.
  b - No longer will segfault if pbs_mom restarts in a bad state (user environment 
      not initialized)
  e - Changing MAXNOTDEFAULT behavior.  Now, by default, max is not default and max
      can be configured as default with --enable-maxdefault.

2.4.4
  b - fixed contrib/init.d/pbs_mom so that it doesn't overwrite $args defined in
      /etc/sysconfig/pbs_mom
  b - when spool_as_final_name is configured for the mom, no longer send email 
      messages about not being able to copy the spool file
  b - when spool_as_final_name is configured for the mom, correctly substitue 
      job environment variables
  f - added logging for email events, allows the admin to check if emails are 
      being sent correctly
  b - Made a fix to svr_get_privilege(). On some architectures a non-root user
      name would be set to null after the line " host_no_port[num_host_chars] = 0;"
      because num_host_chars was = 1024 which was the size of hot_no_port. 
      The null termination needed to happen at 1023. There were other problems
      with this function so code was added to  validate the incoming
      variables before they were used. The symptom of this bug was that non-root
      managers and operators could not perform operations where they should 
      have had rights.
  b - Missed a format statement in an sprintf statement for the bug fix above.
  b - Fixed a way that a file descriptor (for the server lockfile) could be used without 
      initialization. RT 6756

2.4.3
  b - fix PBSD_authenticate so it correctly splits PATH with : instead of ;
      (bugzilla #33)
  b - pbs_mom now sets resource limits for tasks started with tm_spawn (Chris 
      Samuel, VPAC)
  c - fix assumption about size of unsocname.sun_path in Libnet/net_server.c
  b - Fix for Bugzilla bug 34. "torque 2.4.X breaks OSC's mpiexec". fix in src/server
      src/server/stat_job.c revision 3268.
  b - Fix for Bugzilla bug 35 - printing the wrong pid (normal mode) and not
      printing any pid for high availability mode.
  f - added a diagnostic script (contrib/diag/tdiag.sh).  This script grabs 
      the log files for the server and the mom, records the output of qmgr 
      -c 'p s' and the nodefile, and creates a tarfile containing these.
  b - Changed momctl -s to use exit(EXIT_FAILURE) instead of return(-1) if 
      a mom is not running.
  b - Fix for Bugzilla bug 36. "qsub crashes with long dependency list".
  b - Fix for Bugzilla bug 41. "tracejob creates a file in the local directory".

2.4.2
  b - Changed predicate in pbsd_main.c for the two locations where 
      daemonize_server is called to check for the value of high_availability_mode 
      to determine when to put the server process in the background.
  b - Added pbs_error_db.h to src/include/Makefile.am and src/include/Makefile.in. 
      pbs_error_db.h now needed for install.
  e - Modified pbs_get_server_list so the $TORQUE_HOME/server_name file will work with 
      a comma delimited string or a list of server names separated by a new line.
  b - fix tracejob so it handles multiple server and mom logs for the same day
  f - Added a new server parameter np_default. This allows the administrator to
      change the number of processors to a unified value dynamically for the
      entire cluster.
  e - high availability enhanced so that the server spawns a separate thread to
      update the "lock" on the lockfile.  Thread update and check time are both
      setable parameters in qmgr.
  b - close empty ACL files
  
2.4.1
  e - added a prologue and epilogue option to the list of resources for qsub -l
      which allows a per job prologue or epilogue script. The syntax for
      the new option is qsub -l prologue=<prologue script>, 
      epilogue=<epilogue script>
  f - added a "-w" option to qsub to override the working directory
  e - changes needed to allow relocatable checkpoint jobs. Job checkpoint files
      are now under the control of the server.

  f - merged in new dynamic array struct and functions to implement a new (and
      more efficient) way of loading jobs at startup--should help by 2 orders of
      magnitude!
  f - changed TORQUE_MAXCONNECTTIMEOUT to be a global variable that is now 
      changed by the MOM to be smaller than the pbs_server and is also
