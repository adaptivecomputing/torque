/*
 * encode_DIS_svrattrl() - encode a list of server "svrattrl" structures
 *
 * The first item encoded is a unsigned integer, a count of the
 * number of svrattrl entries in the linked list.  This is encoded
 * even when there are no svrattrl entries in the list.
 *
 * Each individual entry is then encoded as:
 *  u int size of the three strings (name, resource, value)
 *   including the terminating nulls
 *  string attribute name
 *  u int 1 or 0 if resource name does or does not follow
 *  string resource name (if one)
 *  string  value of attribute/resource
 *  u int "op" of attrlop
 *
 * Note, the encoding of a svrattrl is the same as the encoding of
 * the pbs_ifl.h structures "attrl" and "attrlop".  Any one of the
 * three forms can be decoded into any of the three with the possible
 * loss of the "flags" field (which is the "op" of the attrlop).
