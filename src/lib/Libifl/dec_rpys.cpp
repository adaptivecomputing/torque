 * decode_DIS_replySvr() - decode a Batch Protocol Reply Structure for Server
 *
 * This routine decodes a batch reply into the form used by server.
 * The only difference between this and the command version is on status
 * replies.  For the server,  the attributes are decoded into a list of
 * server svrattrl structures rather than a commands's attrl.
 *
 *  batch_reply structure defined in libpbs.h, it must be allocated
