This code is eventually compiled into the libpbs.a library.
All actual compilation occurs in ../Libpbs
Originally the libpbs.a file would end up in the directory above
this, since it archived object files from both the Libdis and Libifl
directories. Currently, all objects and compilation occur in Libpbs
and the libpbs.a is left there.

DIAGTODO: create a pbsD_statdiag.c
