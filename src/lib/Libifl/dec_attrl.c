/*
 * decode_DIS_attrl() - decode into a list of PBS API "attrl" structures
 *
 * The space for the attrl structures is allocated as needed.
 *
 * The first item is a unsigned integer, a count of the
 * number of attrl entries in the linked list.  This is encoded
 * even when there are no entries in the list.
 *
 * Each individual entry is encoded as:
 *  u int size of the three strings (name, resource, value)
 *   including the terminating nulls, see dec_svrattrl.c
 *  string attribute name
 *  u int 1 or 0 if resource name does or does not follow
 *  string resource name (if one)
 *  string  value of attribute/resource
 *  u int "op" of attrlop (also flag of svrattrl)
 *
 * Note, the encoding of a attrl is the same as the encoding of
 * the pbs_ifl.h structures "attropl" and the server struct svrattrl.
 * Any one of the three forms can be decoded into any of the three with
 * the possible loss of the "flags" field (which is the "op" of the
 * attrlop).
