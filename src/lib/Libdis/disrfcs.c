/*
 * Synopsis:
 * int disrfcs(int stream, size_t *nchars, size_t achars, char *value)
 *
 * Gets a Data-is-Strings character string from <stream> and converts it
 * into a counted string, puts the string into <value>, a pre-allocated
 * string, <achars> long, and puts the count into *<nchars>.  The character
 * string in <stream> consists of an unsigned integer, followed by a number
 * of characters determined by the unsigned integer.
 *
 * Disrfcs returns DIS_SUCCESS if everything works well.  It returns an
 * error code otherwise.  In case of an error, the <stream> character
 * pointer is reset, making it possible to retry with some other conversion
 * strategy, and <nchars> is set to 0.
