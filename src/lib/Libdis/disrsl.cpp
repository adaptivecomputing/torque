/*
 * Synopsis:
 * long disrsl(int stream, int *retval)
 *
 * Gets a Data-is-Strings signed integer from <stream>, converts it into a
 * long, and returns it.
 *
 * This format for character strings representing signed integers can best
 * be understood through the decoding algorithm:
 *
 * 1. Initialize the digit count to 1.
 *
 * 2. Read the next digit; if it is a sign, go to step (4).
 *
 * 3. Decode a new count from the digit decoded in step (2) and the next
 *    count - 1 digits; repeat step (2).
 *
 * 4. Decode the next count digits as the magnitude of the signed integer.
 *
 * *<retval> gets DIS_SUCCESS if everything works well.  It gets an error
 * code otherwise.  In case of an error, the <stream> character pointer is
 * reset, making it possible to retry with some other conversion strategy.
