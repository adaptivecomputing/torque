/*
 * Synopsis:
 *  int diswl_(int stream, dis_long_double_t value, unsigned int ndigs)
 *
 * Converts <value> into a Data-is-Strings floating point number and sends
 * it to <stream>.  The converted number consists of two consecutive signed
 * integers.  The first is the coefficient, at most <ndigs> long, with its
 * implied decimal point at the low-order end.  The second is the exponent
 * as a power of 10.
 *
 * This function is only invoked through the macros, diswf, diswd, and
 * diswl, which are defined in the header file, dis.h.
 *
 * Returns DIS_SUCCESS if everything works well.  Returns an error code
 * otherwise.  In case of an error, no characters are sent to <stream>.
