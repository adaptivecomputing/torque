 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Hashing functions obtained from http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup3.c
 *  lookup3.c, by Bob Jenkins, May 2006, Public Domain.
 *
 *  These are functions for producing 32-bit hashes for hash table lookup.
 *  hashword(), hashlittle(), hashlittle2(), hashbig(), mix(), and final() 
 *  are externally useful functions.  Routines to test the hash are included 
 *  if SELF_TEST is defined.  You can use this free for any purpose.  It's in
 *  the public domain.  It has no warranty.
 *
 *  You probably want to use hashlittle().  hashlittle() and hashbig()
 *  hash byte arrays.  hashlittle() is is faster than hashbig() on
 *  little-endian machines.  Intel and AMD are little-endian machines.
 *  On second thought, you probably want hashlittle2(), which is identical to
 *  hashlittle() except it returns two 32-bit hashes for the price of one.  
 *  You could implement hashbig2() if you wanted but I haven't bothered here.
 *
 *  If you want to find a hash of, say, exactly 7 integers, do
 *  a = i1;  b = i2;  c = i3;
 *  mix(a,b,c);
 *  a += i4; b += i5; c += i6;
 *  mix(a,b,c);
 *  a += i7;
 *  final(a,b,c);
 *  then use c as the hash value.  If you have a variable length array of
 *  4-byte integers to hash, use hashword().  If you have a byte array (like
 *  a character string), use hashlittle().  If you have several byte arrays, or
 *  a mix of things, see the comments above hashlittle().  
 *
 *  Why is this so big?  I read 12 bytes at a time into 3 4-byte integers, 
 *  then mix those integers.  This is fast (you can do a lot more thorough
 *  mixing with 12*3 instructions on 3 integers than you can with 3 instructions
 *  on 1 byte), but shoehorning those bytes into integers efficiently is messy.

 *  mix -- mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.
 *
 *  This is reversible, so any information in (a,b,c) before mix() is
 *  still in (a,b,c) after mix().
 *
 *  If four pairs of (a,b,c) inputs are run through mix(), or through
 *  mix() in reverse, there are at least 32 bits of the output that
 *  are sometimes the same for one pair and different for another pair.
 *  This was tested for:
 *  * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
 *    of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
 *    (a,b,c).
 *  * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
 *    the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
 *    is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
 *    difference.
 *  * the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or 
 *    all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.
 *
 *  Some k values for my "a-=c; a^=rot(c,k); c+=b;" arrangement that
 *  satisfy this are
 *  4  6  8 16 19  4
 *  9 15  3 18 27 15
 *  14  9  3  7 17  3
 *  Well, "9 15 3 18 27 15" didn't quite get 32 bits diffing
 *  for "differ" defined as + with a one-bit base and a two-bit delta.  I
 *  used http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/avalanche.html to choose 
 *  the operations, constants, and arrangements of the variables.
 *
 *  This does not achieve avalanche.  There are input bits of (a,b,c)
 *  that fail to affect some output bits of (a,b,c), especially of a.  The
 *  most thoroughly mixed value is c, but it doesn't really even achieve
 *  avalanche in c.
 *
 *  This allows some parallelism.  Read-after-writes are good at doubling
 *  the number of bits affected, so the goal of mixing pulls in the opposite
 *  direction as the goal of parallelism.  I did what I could.  Rotates
 *  seem to cost as much as shifts on every machine I could lay my hands
 *  on, and rotates are much kinder to the top and bottom bits, so I used
 *  rotates.
