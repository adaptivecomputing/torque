/*
 * get_path_jobdata
 *
 * Return adjusted path name if needed for subdivided job data directories.
 *
 * For sites expected to have large numbers of queued jobs server_priv/jobs
 * (and arrays) can be subdivided into 10 directories (0..9) to have jobs
 * equally distributed among them to avoid many jobs all in one directory.
 *
 * Sites can chose to use this scheme by setting use_jobs_subdirs to
 * true in the server.
 *
 * This function implements a simple hashing scheme (last digit of the numeric
 * part of the job id) to contruct a path for scripts, job and array data that
 * enables them to be distributed to a numbered directory if use_jobs_subdirs
 * is true. If this parameter has not been set, then the basepath parameter
 * is returned.
 *
 * See buildutils/pbs_mkdirs.in for the required directories that are
 * contructed. See initialize_paths() in src/server/pbsd_init.c
 * for the code that checks the permissions of these directories.
 *
 * @param jobid (I) - job id
 * @param basepath (I) - the base path (most likely path_jobs or path_arrays)
