/** @file This file contains the database of PBS error ids and messages
*
* HOWTO USE THIS
*
* Add new error:
*  - choose the appropriate section (client errors, rm errors)
*  - add new line before the ceiling, the error will be automatically numbered
*
* Remove error:
*  - rewrite the error into a gap (PBSE_GAPxxx or PBSE_RMGAPxxx) with (char*)0
*    as text part (see PBSE_GAP017 for example)
*
* Add new category:
*  - use the same structure for the new category
*  - create new name PbsErrSomething
*  - don't forget the ceiling and floor (and don't forget to give floor a value)
*  - create respective generators in pbs_error.h and pbs_messages.c
*
* @see pbs_error.h and pbs_messages.c for additional info
*
* @note NULL strings should be (const char*)0, but that is not possible right now
