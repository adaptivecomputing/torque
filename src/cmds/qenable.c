/*
 * qenable
 *  The qenable command directs that a destination should accept batch jobs.
 *
 * Synopsis:
 *  qenable destination ...
 *
 * Arguments:
 *  destination ...
 *      A list of destinations.  A destination has one of the following
 *      three forms:
 *          queue
 *          @server
 *          queue@server
 *      If queue is specified, the request is to enable the queue at
 *      the default server.  If @server is given, the request is to
 *      enable the default queue at the server.  If queue@server is
 *      used, the request is to enable the named queue at the named
 *      server.
