.SH RESOURCE UNITS
The resource values take the following units:
.IP time 8
specifies a maximum time period the resource can be used.  Time is expressed
in seconds as an integer, or in the form:
.br
.Ty [[hours:]minutes:]seconds[.milliseconds]
.IP size 8
specifies the maximum amount in terms of bytes or words.  It is expressed
in the form
.Ty integer[suffix]
The suffix is a multiplier defined in the following table,
'b' means bytes (the default) and 'w' means words.
The size of a word is the word size on the execution host.
.RS
.IP "\ b\ or\ \ w" 12
bytes or words.
.IP "kb\ or\ kw"
Kilo (1024) bytes or words.
.IP "mb\ or\ mw" 12
Mega (1,048,576) bytes or words.
.IP "gb\ or\ gw" 12
Giga (1,073,741,824) bytes or words.
.RE
