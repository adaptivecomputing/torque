.Ig
.Al automatic_requeue_exit_code
This is an exit code, defined by the admin, that tells pbs_server to requeue the job
instead of considering it as completed. This allows the user to add some additional
checks that the job can run meaningfully, and if not, then the job script exits with
the specified code to be requeued.

.Ig
.Al default_node
A node specification to use if there is no other supplied specification.
This attribute is only used by servers where a
.I nodes
file exist in the server_priv directory providing a list of nodes to the
server.  If the nodes file does not exist, this attribute is not set by
default and is ignored if set.  The default value allows for jobs to
share a single node.
Format: a node specification string;
default value: 1#shared.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: string]

.Al default_queue
The queue which is the target queue when a request does not specify a queue
name.  Format: a queue name; 
default value: none, must be set to an existing queue.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: string]
.Ig
.Al disable_automatic_requeue
Normally, if a job cannot start due to a transient error, the MOM returns a special exit
code to the server so that the job is requeued instead of completed. When this
parameter is set, the special exit code is ignored and the job is completed.
Format: boolean; default value: false.
.Ig
.Al display_job_server_suffix
When set to TRUE, Torque will display both the job ID and the host name. When set to
FALSE, only the job ID will be displayed.
Format: boolean; default value: true.
.Ig
.Al dont_write_nodes_file

commands to edit nodes will be rejected.
Format: boolean; default value: false.
.Ig
.Al note_append_on_error
Append the error string to the end of the current nodes note if MOM reports a message
beginning with the string "ERROR". Format: boolean; default value: true.
.Ig
.Al down_on_error
Set a node's state to "down" if MOM reports a message beginning with the string
"ERROR".  This might interfere with moab's node error handling.  See the HEALTH
CHECK section in pbs_mom(8B).  This is an EXPERIMENTAL feature and may be
removed in the future.  Format: boolean; default value: true.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al disable_server_id_check
Makes it so the user for the job doesn't have to exist on the server. The user must still exist on all the compute nodes or the job will fail when it tries to execute.
Format: boolean; default value: false
.Ig
.Al extra_resc
Add additional string-type job resources.  They have no effect within TORQUE
and are only advisible to the scheduler.  They can not be used for
resources_default/min/max.  Format: list; default value: none.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: list]
.Ig
.Al interactive_jobs_can_roam
By default, interactive jobs run from the login node that they submitted from. When
TRUE, interactive jobs may run on login nodes other than the one where the jobs were
submitted to.  Only applies when cray_enabled is set.
Format: boolean; default value: false.
.Ig
.Al job_exclusive_on_use
When job_exclusive_on_use is set to TRUE, pbsnodes will show job-exclusive on a
node when there's at least one of its processors running a job. This differs with the
default behavior which is to show job-exclusive on a node when all of its processors
are running a job.
Format: boolean; default value: false.
.Ig
.Al job_force_cancel_time
If configured, number of seconds after a delete where a job will be purged by the server. If not configured, no such thing happens.
Format: integer; default value: not used.
.Ig
.Al job_full_report_time
Sets the time in seconds that a job should be fully reported after any kind of change
to the job, even if condensed output was requested.
Format: integer; default value: 300 seconds.
.Ig
.Al job_log_file_max_size
This specifies a soft limit (in kilobytes) for the job log's maximum size. The file size 
is checked every five minutes and if the current day file size is greater than or equal
to this value, it is rolled from <filename> to <filename.1> and a new empty log is
opened. If the current day file size exceeds the maximum size a second time, the
<filename.1> log file is rolled to <filename.2>, the current log is rolled to
<filename.1>, and a new empty log is opened. Each new log causes all other logs to
roll to an extension that is one greater than its current number. Any value less than 0
is ignored by pbs_server (meaning the log will not be rolled).
Format: integer; default value: none.
.Ig
.Al job_log_file_roll_depth
This sets the maximum number of new log files that are kept in a day if the
job_log_file_max_size parameter is set. For example, if the roll depth is set to 3, no
file can roll higher than <filename.3>. If a file is already at the specified depth, such
as <filename.3>, the file is deleted so it can be replaced by the incoming file roll,
<filename.2>.
Format: integer; default value: none.
.Ig
.Al job_log_keep_days
This maintains job logs for the number of days designated. If set to 4, any job log file older
than 4 days old is deleted.
Format: integer; default value: none.
.Ig
.Al job_nanny
Enables the "job deletion nanny" feature.  All job cancels will
create a repeating task that will resend KILL signals if the initial job cancel
failed.  Further job cancels will be rejected with the message "job cancel in
progress." This is useful for temporary failures with a job's execution node
during a job delete request.  It is possible that the job nanny might interfere
with job restarts, migrations, and checkpointing.  Format: boolean; default value: false.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: boolean]
.Ig
.Al job_start_timeout
Specifies the pbs_server to pbs_mom TCP socket timeout in seconds that is used
when the pbs_server sends a job start to the pbs_mom.  It is useful when the mom
has extra overhead involved in starting jobs.  If not specified then the
tcp_timeout value is used.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al job_stat_rate
Moderates how often job stat requests will be issued from pbs_server
to the MOM daemons.  If poll_jobs is unset or false, then all jobs that
haven't been updated in job_stat_rate seconds will trigger a stat request.  
If poll_jobs is true, then all jobs will be updated every job_stat_rate.
 (see poll_jobs)  On active clusters, 60 or 120 might be reasonable.
Default value: 45 seconds  (PBS_RESTAT_JOB in server_limits.h)
Minimum value: 4 seconds  (PBS_JOBSTAT_MIN in server_limits.h)
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al job_sync_timeout
When a stray job is reported on multiple nodes, the server sends a kill signal to one
node at a time. This timeout determines how long the server waits between kills if the
job is still being reported on any nodes.
Format: integer; default value: 60.
.Ig
.Al keep_completed
Number of seconds to retain completed jobs in the C state.  This is overridden
by the execution queue attribute of the same name.
Format: integer; default value: 0.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al kill_delay
The amount of the time delay between the sending of SIGTERM and SIGKILL
when a qdel command is issued against a running job.  This is overridden
by the execution queue attribute of the same name. Format: integer
seconds; default value: 2 seconds.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al lock_file
Specifies the name and location of the lock file used to determine which high availability server should be active. 
.br
If a full path is specified, it is used verbatim by TORQUE. If a relative path is specified, TORQUE will prefix it with $TORQUE_HOME/server_priv.
Format: string; default value: $TORQUE_HOME/server_priv/server.lock
.Ig
.Al lock_file_update_time
Specifies how often (in seconds) the thread will update the lockfile. (for threaded high availability)
Format: integer; default value: 3
.Ig
.Al lock_file_check_time
Specifies how often (in seconds) a high availability server will check
to see if it should become active. (for threaded high availability) Must be greater than lock_file_update_time.
Format: integer; default value: 9
.Ig
.Al log_events
A bit string which specifies the type of events which are logged, see
the section on Event Logging in chapter 3 of the ERS.  Format: integer;
default value: 511, all events.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]
.Ig
.Al log_file_max_size
If this is set to a value > 0 then pbs_server will roll the current log file
to logfile.1 when its size is greater than or equal to the value of
log_file_max_size. This value is interpreted as kilobytes.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
[internal type: integer]

.Al max_slot_limit
No array can request a slot limit greater than 10. Any array that does not request a slot limit receives a slot limit of 10. Using the example above, slot requests greater than 10 are rejected.
A slot limit is the maximum number of jobs from an array that can run concurrently.

This is the maximum number of threads that should exist in the thread pool at any 
time.
Format: integer; default value: ((2 * the number of procs listed in /proc/cpuinfo) + 1) * 20
.Ig
.Al max_user_queuable
When set, max_user_queuable places a system-wide limit on the amount of jobs that
an individual user can queue.
Format: integer; default value: unlimited.

This parameter places a hold on jobs that exceed the slot limit in a job array. When
one of the active jobs is completed or deleted, one of the held jobs goes to a queued
state.
Format: boolean; default value: true.
.Ig
.Al mom_job_sync
Enables the "job sync on MOM" feature.   When MOMs send a status
update, and it includes a list of jobs, server will issue job deletes for any
jobs that don't actually exist.  Format: boolean; default value: true.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

.Al next_job_number
This hidden attribute is used to allow a manager to set the value of the 
next job ID via qmgr. This attribute should rarely be modified. Some sites 
may find it useful if they need to recreate their pbs_server 
database (perhaps due to a format change between major TORQUE versions) and 
they keep a database of job information indexed by the job ID. The manager 
should be careful to avoid setting the value to something that would allow 
the next job number to conflict with a job already queued, however Torque 
will handle this in a sane manner: the job submission will be rejected and 
the next job number will be incremented.

.Al node_pack
Controls how multiple processor nodes are allocated to jobs.
If this attribute is set to true, jobs will be assigned to the multiple
processor nodes with the fewest free processors.
This packs jobs into the fewest possible nodes leaving multiple processor nodes
free for jobs which need many processors on a node.
If set to false,  jobs will be scattered across nodes reducing
conflicts over memory between jobs.   
If unset, the jobs are packed on nodes in the order that the nodes are

np_default allows the administrator to unify the number of processors (np) on all nodes. The value can be dynamically changed. A value of 0 tells pbs_server to use the value of np found in the nodes file. The maximum value is 32767.
Format: integer; default value: not used.

.Al pass_cpuclock
If set to TRUE, the pbs_server daemon passes the option and its value to the
pbs_mom daemons for direct implementation by the daemons, making the
CPU frequency adjustable as part of a resource request by a job submission.
If set to FALSE, the pbs_server daemon creates and passes a PBS_CPUCLOCK job
 environment variable to the pbs_mom daemons that contains the value of the 
cpuclock attribute used as part of a resource request by a job submission. 
The CPU frequencies on the MOMs are not adjusted. The environment variable is 
for use by prologue and epilogue scripts, enabling administrators to log and 
research when users are making cpuclock requests, as well as researchers and 
developers to perform CPU clock frequency changes using a method outside of 
that employed by the Torque pbs_mom daemons.
Format: boolean;  default value: true.
.Ig
.Al poll_jobs
Controls how pbs_server will send job status requests to MOMs.  When unset or
false, statjob requests from clients (ie: qstat(1B) or the scheduler) may
trigger job status requests to MOMs and and must wait until the MOMs have
replied; this is suitable for small to medium sized clusters.  When set to
true, pbs_server will send periodic job status requests; this is suitable for
busy clusters with lots of jobs, lots of clients, qstat(1B) is too slow, or
your scheduler times out.  (see job_stat_rate) 
Default value: TRUE

.Al "resources_available"
The list of resource and amounts available to jobs run by this server.
The sum of the resource of each type used by all jobs running by this server
cannot exceed the total amount listed here.

.Al resources_cost
The cost factors of various types of resources.  These values are used in
determining the order of releasing members of synchronous job sets, see
the section on \*QSynchronize Job Starts.\*U  For the most part, these value
are purely arbitrary and have meaning only in the relative values between
systems.  The \*Qcost\*U of the resources requested by a job is the sum of the
products of the various 
.I resources_cost s
and the amount of each resource requested by the job.  
It is not necessary to assign a cost for each possible resource, only those
which the site wishes to be considered in synchronous job scheduling.

.Al scheduling
Controls if the server will request job scheduling by the PBS job scheduler.
If true, the scheduler will be called as required; if false, the scheduler
will not be called and no job will be placed into execution unless the
server is directed to do so by an operator or administrator.  Setting or 
resetting this attribute to true results in an immediate call to the scheduler.
For more information, see the section
.B "Scheduler \- Server Interaction"
in the PBS Administrator Guide.
Format: boolean (see
acl_host_enable);
default value: value of \-a option when server is invoked, if \-a is not
specified, the value is recovered from the prior server run.  If it has never
been set, the value is "false".

The specific timeout used when requeuing jobs because the node they are executing
on is being deleted.
Format: integer; default value: 120.
.Ig
.Al use_jobs_subdirs
Lets an administrator direct the way pbs_server will store its job-related files.
When use_jobs_subdirs is unset (or set to FALSE), job and job array files will be
stored directly under $PBS_HOME/server_priv/jobs and
$PBS_HOME/server_priv/arrays. 
When use_job_subdirs is set to TRUE, job and job array files will be distributed
over 10 subdirectories under their respective parent directories. This method
helps to keep a smaller number of files in a given directory. 
Format: boolean; default value: false.
