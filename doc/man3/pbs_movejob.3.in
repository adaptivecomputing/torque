pbs_movejob \- move a pbs batch job to a new destination
.SH SYNOPSIS

int pbs_movejob(\^int\ connect, char\ *job_id, char\ *destination,

.SH DESCRIPTION
Issue a batch request to move a job to a new destination.
The job is removed from the present queue and instantiated in a new
queue.
.LP
A
.I "Move Job"
batch request is generated and sent to the server over the connection
specified by
.Ar connect 
which is the return value of \fBpbs_connect\fP().
.LP
The 
.Ar job_id
parameter identifies which job is to be moved; it is specified in the form:
.Ty "sequence_number.server"
.LP
The
.Ar destination
parameter specifies the new destination for the job.  It is specified as:
.Ty [queue][@server] .
If
.Ar destination
is a null pointer or a null string,
the destination will be the default queue at the current server.  If
.Ar destination
specifies a queue but not a server, the destination will be the named queue
at the current server.  If
.Ar destination
specifies a server but not a queue, the destination will be
the default queue at the named server.  If
.Ar destination
specifies both a queue and a server, the destination is that queue at that 
server.
.LP
A job in the
.B Running ,
.B Transiting ,
or
.B Exiting
state cannot be moved.
.LP
The parameter,
.Ar extend ,
is reserved for implementation defined extensions.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When the batch request generated by \fBpbs_movejob\fP()
function has been completed successfully by a batch server, the routine will
return 0 (zero).
Otherwise, a non zero error is returned.  The error number is also set
in pbs_errno.
