.SH NAME
pbs_mom \- start a pbs batch execution mini-server
.SH SYNOPSIS
pbs_mom [\^\-a\ alarm\^] [\^\-C\ chkdirectory\^] [\^\-c\ config\^] [\^\-d\ directory] [\^\-h\ help] [\^\-H\ hostname] [\^\-L\ logfile] [\^\-M\ MOMport\^] [\^\-R\ RPPport\^] [\^\-p\^|\^\-q\^|\^\-r] [\^\-x]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pbs_mom
command starts the operation of a batch \fBM\fPachine \fBO\fPriented
\fBM\fPini\-server, MOM, on the local host.
Typically, this command will be in a local boot file such as
.I /etc/rc.local .
To insure that the pbs_mom
command is not runnable by the general user community, the server
will only execute if its real and effective uid is zero.
.LP
One function of pbs_mom is to place jobs into execution as directed
by the server, establish resource usage limits, monitor the job's usage,
and notify the server when the job completes.  If they exist, pbs_mom will
execute a prologue script before executing a job and an epilogue script
after executing the job.
The next function of pbs_mom is to respond to resource monitor requests.
This was done by a separate process in previous versions of PBS but
has now been combined into one process.
The resource monitor function is provided mainly for the PBS scheduler.
It provides information about the status of running jobs, memory available etc.
The next function of pbs_mom is to respond to task manager requests.
This involves communicating with running tasks over a tcp socket
as well as communicating with other MOMs within a job (aka a "sisterhood").
.LP
Pbs_mom will record a diagnostic message in a log file for any
error occurrence.  The log files are maintained in the 
.I mom_logs
directory below the home directory of the server.
If the log file cannot be opened, the diagnostic message is written
to the system console.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-A alias" 16
Used with \-m (multi-mom option) to give the alias name of this instance 
of pbs_mom
.IP "\-a alarm" 16
Specifies the alarm timeout in seconds for computing a resource.
Every time a resource request is processed, an alarm is set for the
given amount of time.  If the request has not completed before the
given time, an alarm signal is generated.
The default is 5 seconds.
.IP "\-C chkdirectory" 16
Specifies the path of the directory used to hold checkpoint files.
[Currently this is only valid on Cray systems.]
The default directory is PBS_HOME/spool/checkpoint, see the \-d option.
The directory specified with the \-C option must be owned by root and 
accessible (rwx) only by root to protect the security of the checkpoint files.
.IP "\-c config" 16
Specifies an alternative configuration file, see description below.
If this is a relative file name it will be relative to PBS_HOME/mom_priv,
see the \-d option.  If the specified file cannot be opened, pbs_mom will abort.
If the \-c option is not supplied, pbs_mom will attempt to open the default
 configuration file "config" in PBS_HOME/mom_priv.  If this file is not
present, pbs_mom will log the fact and continue.
.IP "\-h help" 16
Displays the help/usage message.
.IP "\-H hostname" 16
Sets the MOM's hostname.  This can be useful on multi-homed networks.
.IP "\-d directory" 16
Specifies the path of the directory which is the home of the servers
working files, PBS_HOME.
This option is typically used along with \-M when debugging MOM.
The default directory is given by $PBS_SERVER_HOME
which is typically
.Ty /usr/spool/PBS .
.IP "\-L logfile" 16
Specifies an absolute path name for use as the log file.
If not specified, MOM will
open a file named for the current date in the PBS_HOME/mom_logs
directory, see the
.At \-d
option.
.IP "\-m" 16
Directs the MOM to start in multi-mom mode. In addition to using -m the
\-M, \-R and \-A options need to be used to properly start a MOM in multi-mom mode.
For example 
.B pbs_mom -m -M 30002 -R 30003 -A alias-host 
will start pbs_mom with the service port on port 30002, the manager port at 30003 and with 
the name alias-host.
.IP "\-M port" 16
Specifies the port number on which the mini-server (MOM) will
listen for batch requests.  
.IP "\-R port" 16
Specifies the port number on which the mini-server (MOM) will
listen for resource monitor requests, task manager requests and inter-MOM
messages. 
.IP "\-p" 16
(Default after version 2.4.0) (Preserve running jobs) -- Specifies the 
impact on jobs which were in execution when the	mini-server shut-down. 
The \-p option tries to preserve any running jobs when the MOM restarts. 
The new mini-server will not be the parent of any running jobs, MOM 
has lost control of her	offspring (not a new situation for a mother). 
The MOM will allow the jobs to continue to run and monitor them 
indirectly via polling. All recovered jobs will report an exit code 
of 0 when they are complete. The \-p option is mutually exclusive with 
the \-r, \-P and \-q options.
.IP "\-P" 16
(Terminate all jobs and remove them from the queue) -- Specifies the impact 
on jobs which were in execution when the mini-server shut-down.  
With the \-P option, it is assumed that either the entire system
has been restarted or the MOM has been down so long that it can no longer
guarantee that the pid of any running process is the same as the recorded job
process pid of a recovering job. Unlike the \-p option no attempt is made to
try and preserve or recover running jobs. All jobs are terminated and removed
from the queue.
The \-q option is mutually exclusive with the \-p, \-q and \-r options.
.IP "\-q" 16
(Requeue all jobs - This is the default behavior in versions prior
to 2.4.0) -- Specifies the impact on jobs which were in execution when 
the mini-servershut-down. Do not terminate running processes.
With the \-q option, it is assumed that either the entire system
has been restarted or the MOM has been down so long that it can no longer
guarantee that the pid of any running process is the same as the recorded job
process pid of a recovering job. No attempt is made to kill job processes. 
The MOM will mark the jobs as terminated and notify the batch server which 
owns the job. Re-runnable jobs will be requeued.
The \-q option is mutually exclusive with the \-p, \-P and \-r options.
.IP "\-r" 16
(Terminate running processes and requeue all jobs) -- Specifies the impact on jobs 
which were in execution when the mini-server shut-down. With the \-r option,
MOM will kill any processes belonging to running jobs, mark the jobs as 
terminated and notify the batch server that owns the job. Re-runnable jobs are reset 
to a queued state so they can be run again.
The \-r option is mutually exclusive with the \-p, \-P and \-q options.
.IP
If the \-r option is used following a reboot,
process IDs (pids) may be reused and
MOM may kill a process that is not a batch session.
.IP "\-S port" 16
Specifies the port number on which the pbs_server is listening for requests.
If pbs_server is started with a \-p option, pbs_mom will need to use the \-S
option and match the port value which was used to start pbs_server.
.IP "\-x" 16
Disables the check for privileged port resource monitor connections.  This is
used mainly for testing since the privileged port is the only
mechanism used to prevent any ordinary user from connecting.
.LP
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file may be specified on the command line at
program start with the \-c flag.  The use of this file is
to provide several types of run time information to pbs_mom:
static resource names and values, external resources provided 
by a program to be run on request via a shell escape, and values
to pass to internal set up functions at initialization
(and re-initialization).
.LP
Each item type is on a single line with the component parts separated by
white space.  If the line starts with a hash mark (pound sign, #), 
the line is considered to be a comment and is skipped.
.IP "Static Resources"
For static resource names and values, the configuration file contains a
list of resource names/values pairs, one pair per line and separated by
white space.   An Example of static resource names and values could be 
the number of tape drives of different types and could be specified by
.IP
.Ty "tape3480      4"
.br
.Ty "tape3420      2"
.br
.Ty "tapedat       1"
.br
.Ty "tape8mm       1"
.IP "Shell Commands"
If the first character of the value is an exclamation mark (!),
the entire rest of the line is saved to be executed through the services of
the \fBsystem\fP(3) standard library routine.
.IP
The shell escape provides a means for the resource monitor to yield
arbitrary information to the scheduler.  Parameter substitution is
done such that the value of any qualifier sent with the query, as
explained below, replaces a token with a percent sign (%) followed
by the name of the qualifier.  For example, here is a configuration file
line which gives a resource name of "escape":
.IP
.Ty "escape     !echo %xxx %yyy"
.IP
If a query for "escape" is sent with no qualifiers, the command
executed would be "echo %xxx %yyy".  If one qualifier is sent,
"escape[xxx=hi there]", the command executed would be "echo hi there %yyy".
If two qualifiers are sent, "escape[xxx=hi][yyy=there]", the command
executed would be "echo hi there".  If a qualifier is sent with
no matching token in the command line, "escape[zzz=snafu]", an error
is reported.
.IP size[fs=<FS>]
Specifies that the available and configured disk space in the <FS> filesystem
is to be reported to the pbs_server and scheduler.  NOTE: To request disk space
on a per job basis, specify the file resource as in 'qsub \-l
nodes=1,file=1000kb'  For example, the available and configured disk space in
the /localscratch filesystem will be reported:
.IP
.Ty "size[fs=/localscratch]"
.br
.IP "Initialization Value"
An initialization value directive has a name which starts with a
dollar sign ($) and must be known to MOM via an internal table.
The entries in this table now are: 
.RS
.IP auto_ideal_load
if jobs are running, sets idea_load based on a simple expression.  The expressions
start with the variable 't' (total assigned CPUs) or 'c' (existing CPUs), an
operator (+ \- / *), and followed by a float constant.
.IP
.Ty "$auto_ideal_load t-0.2"
.br
.IP auto_max_load
if jobs are running, sets max_load based on a simple expression.  The expressions
start with the variable 't' (total assigned CPUs) or 'c' (existing CPUs), an
operator (+ \- / *), and followed by a float constant.
.IP cputmult
which sets a factor used to adjust cpu time used by a job.  This is provided
to allow adjustment of time charged and limits enforced where the job might
run on systems with different cpu performance. 
If Mom's system is faster than the reference system, set cputmult to a decimal
value greater than 1.0.   If Mom's system is slower, set cputmult to a value
between 1.0 and 0.0.
For example:
.IP
.Ty "$cputmult 1.5
.br
.Ty "$cputmult 0.75
.IP configversion
specifies the version of the config file data, a string.
.IP check_poll_time
specifies the MOM interval in seconds.  MOM checks each job for updated
resource usages, exited processes, over-limit conditions, etc. once per
interval.  This value should be equal or lower to pbs_server's job_stat_rate.
High values result in stale information reported to pbs_server.  Low values
result in increased system usage by MOM.  Default is 45 seconds.
.IP down_on_error
causes MOM to report itself as state "down" to pbs_server in the event of a
failed health check.  This feature is EXPERIMENTAL and likely to be removed in
the future.  See HEALTH CHECK below.
.IP enablemomrestart
enable automatic restarts of MOM.  If enabled, MOM will check if its binary has
been updated and restart itself at a safe point when no jobs are running; thus
making upgrades easier.  The check is made by comparing the mtime of the
pbs_mom executable.  Command-line args, the process name, and the PATH env
variable are preserved across restarts.  It is recommended that this not be
enabled in the config file, but enabled when desired with momctl (see RESOURCES
for more information.)
.IP ideal_load
ideal processor load.  Represents a low water mark for the load average.  Nodes
that are currently busy will consider itself free after falling below ideal_load.
.IP igncput
Ignore cpu time violations on this mom, meaning jobs will not be cancelled due to exceeding their limits for cpu time.
.IP ignmem 
Ignore memory violations on this mom, meaning jobs will not be cancelled due to exceeding their memory limits.
.IP ignvmem
If set to true, then pbs_mom will ignore vmem/pvmem limit enforcement.
.IP ignwalltime
If set to true, then pbs_mom will ignore walltime limit enforcement.
.IP job_output_file_mask
Specifies a mask for creating job output and error files. Values can be specified in base 8, 10, or 16; leading 0 implies octal and leading 0x or 0X hexadecimal. A value of "userdefault" will use the user's default umask.
.Ty "$job_output_file_mask 027"
.br
.IP log_directory
Changes the log directory. Default is $TORQUEHOME/mom_logs/. $TORQUEHOME default is /var/spool/torque/ but can be changed in the ./configure script. The value is a string and should be the full path to the desired mom log directory.
.Ty "$log_directory /opt/torque/mom_logs/"
.br
.IP logevent
which sets the mask that determines which event types are logged by pbs_mom.
For example:
.IP
.Ty "$logevent 0x1fff"
.br
.Ty "$logevent 255"
.IP
The first example would set the log event mask to 0x1ff (511) which enables
logging of all events including debug events.  The second example would set
the mask to 0x0ff (255) which enables all events except debug events.
.IP log_file_suffix
Optional suffix to append to log file names. If %h is the suffix, pbs_mom appends the hostname for where the log files are stored if it knows it, otherwise it will append the hostname where the mom is running.
.Ty "$log_file_suffix tom = 20100223.tom"
.br
.IP log_keep_days
Specifies how many days to keep log files. pbs_mom deletes log files older than the specified number of days. If not specified, pbs_mom won't delete log files based on their age.
.IP loglevel
specifies the verbosity of logging with higher numbers specifying more verbose
logging.  Values may range between 0 and 7.
.IP log_file_max_size
If  this  is set to a value > 0 then pbs_mom will roll the
current log file to log-file-name.1 when its size is  greater  than
or  equal  to  the  value of log_file_max_size. This value is
interpreted as kilobytes.
.
.IP log_file_roll_depth
If this is set to a value >=1 and  log_file_max_size  is  set
then  pbs_mom  will continue rolling the log files to 
log-file-name.log_file_roll_depth.
.
.IP max_load
maximum processor load.  Nodes over this load average are considered busy (see
ideal_load above).
.
.IP memory_pressure_threshold
The option is only available, if pbs_mom is enabled to use cpusets.
If set to a value > 0, a job gets killed if its memory pressure exceeds
this value, and if $memory_pressure_duration is set.
The default is 0 (memory pressure recording is off). 
.br
See cpuset(7) for more information about memory pressure.
.IP memory_pressure_duration
The option is only available, if pbs_mom is enabled to use cpusets.
Specifies the number of subsequent MOM intervals a job's memory pressure must be
above $memory_pressure_threshold to get killed.
The default is 0 (jobs are never killed due to memory pressure).
set
.br
See cpuset(7) for more information about memory pressure.
.
.IP node_check_script
specifies the fully qualified pathname of the health check script to run (see
HEALTH CHECK for more information).
.IP node_check_interval
specifies when to run the MOM health check.  The check can be either periodic,
event-driver, or both.  The value starts with an integer specifying the number
of MOM intervals between subsequent executions of the specified health check.
After the integer is an optional comma-separated list of event names.
Currently supported are "jobstart" and "jobend".  This value defaults to 1 with
no events indicating the check is run every MOM interval. (see HEALTH CHECK for
more information)
.IP
.Ty "$node_check_interval 0  #Disabled."
.br
.Ty "$node_check_interval 0,jobstart  #Only runs at job starts"
.br
.Ty "$node_check_interval 10,jobstart,jobend"
.IP
.IP nodefile_suffix
Specifies the suffix to append to a host names to denote the data channel network adapter in a multihomed compute node.
.Ty "$nodefile_suffix i"
With the suffix of 'i' and the control channel adapter with the name node01, the data channel would have a hostname of node01i.
.IP nospool_dir_list
If the job's output file should be in one of the paths specified here, then it will be spooled directly in that directory instead of the normal spool directory.
.br
Specified in the format path1, path2, etc.
.Ty $nospool_dir_list /home/mike/*,/var/tmp/spool/
.IP pbsclient
which causes a host name to be added to the list of hosts which will be allowed
to connect to MOM as long as they are using a privilaged port for the purposes
of resource monitor requests.
For example, here are two
configuration file lines which will allow the hosts "fred" and "wilma"
to connect:
.IP
.Ty "$pbsclient      fred"
.br
.Ty "$pbsclient      wilma"
.IP
Two host name are always allowed to connection to pbs_mom, "localhost" and the
name returned to pbs_mom by the system call gethostname().  These names need
not be specified in the configuration file.  The hosts listed as "clients" can
issue Resource Monitor (RM) requests.  Other MOM nodes and servers do not need
to be listed as clients.
.IP pbsserver
which defines hostnames running pbs_server that will be allowed to
submit jobs, issue Resource Monitor (RM) requests, and get status updates.  MOM
will continually attempt to contact all server hosts for node status and state
updates.  Like $PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_name, the hostname may be followed by a
colon and a port number.  This parameter replaces the oft-confused $clienthost
parameter from TORQUE 2.0.0p0 and earlier.  Note that the hostname in
$PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_name is used if no $pbsserver parameters are found
.IP prologalarm
Specifies maximum duration (in seconds) which the MOM will wait for the job prolog
or job job epilog to complete.  This parameter default to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
.IP rcpcmd
Specify the the full path and argument to be used for remote file copies.  This overrides
the compile-time default found in configure.  This must contain 2 words: the full path to
the command and the switches.  The copy command must be able to recursively copy files to
the remote host and accept arguments of the form "user@host:files"  For example:
.IP
.Ty "$rcpcmd /usr/bin/rcp \-rp
.br
.Ty "$rcpcmd /usr/bin/scp \-rpB
.IP restricted
which causes a host name to be added to the list of hosts which will be allowed
to connect to MOM without needing to use a privilaged port.  These names
allow for wildcard matching.  For example, here is a configuration file
line which will allow queries from any host from the domain "ibm.com".
.IP
.Ty "$restricted      *.ibm.com"
.IP
The restriction which applies to these connections is that only
internal queries may be made.  No resources from a config file
will be found.  This is to prevent any shell commands from being
run by a non-root process.
.br
This parameter is generally not required except for some versions of OSX.
.IP remote_checkpoint_dirs
Specifies what server checkpoint directories are remotely mounted.  This directive is used to
tell the MOM which directories are shared with the server.  Using remote checkpoint directories eliminates the need to copy the checkpoint files back and forth between the MOM and the server. This parameter is available in 2.4.1 and later.
.IP
.Ty "$remote_checkpoint_dirs /var/spool/torque/checkpoint"
.IP remote_reconfig
Enables the ability to remotely reconfigure pbs_mom with a new config file.
Default is disabled.  This parameter accepts various forms of true, yes, and 1.
.IP source_login_batch
Specifies whether or not mom will source the /etc/profile, etc. type files for batch jobs. Parameter accepts various forms of true, false, yes, no, 1 and 0. Default is True.
.IP source_login_interactive
Specifies whether or not mom will source the /etc/profile, etc. type files for interactive jobs. Parameter accepts various forms of true, false, yes, no, 1 and 0. Default is True.
.IP spool_as_final_name
If set to true, jobs will spool directly as their output files, with no intermediate locations or steps. This is mostly useful for shared filesystems with fast writing capability. 
.IP status_update_time
Specifies (in seconds) how often MOM updates its status information to
pbs_server.  This value should correlate with the server's scheduling interval.
High values increase the load of pbs_server and the network.  Low values cause
pbs_server to report stale information.  Default is 45 seconds.
.IP tmpdir 
Sets the directory basename for a per-job temporary directory.  Before job
launch, MOM will append the jobid to the tmpdir basename and create the
directory.  After the job exit, MOM will recursively delete it.  The env
variable TMPDIR will be set for all pro/epilog scripts, the job script, and TM
tasks.
.br
Directory creation and removal is done as the job owner and group, so the owner
must have write permission to create the directory.  If the directory already
exists and is owned by the job owner, it will not be deleted after the job.  If
the directory already exists and is NOT owned by the job owner, the job start
will be rejected.
.IP timeout
Specifies the number of seconds before TCP messages will time out.  TCP messages include job obituaries, and TM requests if RPP is disabled.
Default is 60 seconds.
.IP usecp
specifies which directories should be staged with cp instead of rcp/scp.  If a
shared filesystem is available on all hosts in a cluster, this directive is used to
make these filesystems known to MOM.  For example, if /home is NFS mounted on
all nodes in a cluster:
.IP
.Ty "$usecp *:/home  /home"
.br
.IP varattr
This is similar to a shell escape above, but includes a TTL.  The command will
only be run every TTL seconds.  A TTL of \-1 will cause the command to be
executed only once.  A TTL of 0 will cause the command to be run everytime
varattr is requested.  This parameter may be used multiple times, but all
output will be grouped into a single "varattr" attribute in the request and
status output.  The command should output data in the form of 
.Ty varattrname=va1ue1[+value2]...
.IP
.Ty "$varattr 3600 /path/to/script [<ARGS>]..."
.IP use_smt
This option is only available, if pbs_mom is enabled to use cpusets.
It has only effect, if there are more that one logical processor per physical
core in the system (simultaneous multithreading or hyperthreading is enabled
via BIOS settings).
If set to true, all logical processors of allocated cores are added to the cpuset
of a job. If set to false, only the first logical processor per allocated core
is contained in the cpuset of a job.
The default is true.
.IP wallmult
which sets a factor used to adjust wall time usage by to job to a common
reference system.  The factor is used for walltime calculations and limits
the same as cputmult is used for cpu time.
.RE
.LP
The configuration file must be executable and "secure".  It must be owned by a user id and
group id less than 10 and not be world writable.  Output from this file must be in
the format $VAR=$VAL, i.e.,
.IP
.Ty dataset13=20070104
.br
.Ty dataset22=20070202

.IP xauthpath
Specifies the path to the xauth binary to enable X11 fowarding.
.IP mom_host
Sets the local hostname as used by pbs_mom.
.br
.SH LAYOUT FILE
There is also an optional layout file for creating multiple moms on one box in a specified layout. In the file, each mom on the single box is given its own hostname, cpu indexes, memory nodes (a linux construct), and memory size. This is useful for NUMA systems. Each line in the file specifies one mom. The file follows the following format:
.IP "<hostname> cpus=<X> mem=<Y> memsize=<Z>"
cpus and mem can be comma separated lists, while memsize should be a memory size in the format:
.IP "<number><units>"
For example, a file could contain the following line:
.IP "foohost-1 cpus=1,2 mem=1,2,3,4 memsize=8GB"
This would specify that foohost-1 has cpus 1 and 2, memory nodes 1-4, and a total of 8 GB of memory.
.SH RESOURCES
Resource Monitor queries can be made with momctl's \-q option to retrieve and
set pbs_mom options.  Any configured static resource may be retrieved with a
request of the same name.  These are resource requests not otherwise documented
in the PBS ERS.
.IP cycle
forces an immediate MOM cycle
.IP status_update_time
retrieve or set the $status_update_time parameter
.IP check_poll_time
retrieve or set the $check_poll_time parameter
.IP configversion
retrieve the config version
.IP jobstartblocktime
retrieve or set the $jobstartblocktime parameter
.IP enablemomrestart
retrieve or set the $enablemomrestart parameter
.IP loglevel
retrieve or set the $loglevel parameter
.IP down_on_error
retrieve or set the EXPERIMENTAL $down_on_error parameter
.IP "diag0 \- diag4"
retrieves various diagnostic information
.IP rcpcmd
retrieve or set the $rcpcmd parameter
.IP version
retrieves the pbs_mom version
.SH HEALTH CHECK
The health check script is executed directly by the pbs_mom daemon under the
root user id. It must be accessible from the compute node and may be a script
or compiled executable program.  It may make any needed system calls and execute
any combination of system utilities but should not execute resource manager
client commands.  Also, as of TORQUE 1.0.1, the pbs_mom daemon blocks until the
health check is completed and does not possess a built-in timeout.
Consequently, it is advisable to keep the launch script execution time short
and verify that the script will not block even under failure conditions.
.LP
If the script detects a failure, it should return the keyword 'ERROR' to stdout
followed by an error message.  The message (up to 256 characters) immediately
following the ERROR string will be assigned to the node attribute 'message' of
the associated node. 
.LP
If the script detects a failure when run from "jobstart", then the job will be
rejected.  This should probably only be used with advanced schedulers like Moab
so that the job can be routed to another node.
.LP
TORQUE currently ignores ERROR messages by default, but advanced schedulers
like moab can be configured to react appropriately.
.LP
If the experimental $down_on_error MOM setting is enabled, MOM will set itself
to state down and report to pbs_server; and pbs_server will report the node as
"down".  Additionally, the experimental "down_on_error" server attribute can be
enabled which has the same effect but moves the decision to pbs_server.  It is
redundant to have MOM's $down_on_error and pbs_server's down_on_error features
enabled.  See "down_on_error" in pbs_server_attributes(7B).

.SH FILES
.IP $PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_name
contains the hostname running pbs_server.
.IP $PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_priv 10
the default directory for configuration files, typically
(/usr/spool/pbs)/mom_priv.
.IP $PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_logs 10
directory for log files recorded by the server.
.IP $PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_priv/prologue 10
the administrative script to be run before job execution.
.IP $PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_priv/epilogue 10
the administrative script to be run after job execution.
.SH SIGNAL HANDLING
pbs_mom handles the following signals:
.IP SIGHUP
causes pbs_mom to re-read its configuration file, close and reopen the log
file, and reinitialize resource structures.
.IP SIGALRM
results in a log file entry. The signal is used to limit the time taken by
certain children processes, such as the prologue and epilogue.
.IP "SIGINT and SIGTERM"
results in pbs_mom exiting without terminating any running jobs.
This is the action for the following signals as well: SIGXCPU, SIGXFSZ,
SIGCPULIM, and SIGSHUTDN.
.IP "SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2"
causes MOM to increase and decrease logging levels, respectively.
.IP "SIGPIPE, SIGINFO"
 are ignored.
.IP "SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGTRAP, and SIGSYS"
cause a core dump if the PBSCOREDUMP environmental variable is defined.
.LP
All other signals have their default behavior installed.
.SH EXIT STATUS
If the mini-server command fails to begin operation, the
server exits with a value greater than zero.
