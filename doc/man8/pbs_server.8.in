[\-\-about] [\-\-ha] [\-\-help] [\-\-version]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pbs_server
command starts the operation of a batch server on the local host.
Typically, this command will be in a local boot file such as
.I /etc/rc.local .
If the batch server is already in execution, 
.B pbs_server
will exit with an error.
To insure that the 
.B pbs_server
command is not runnable by the general user community, the server
will only execute if its real and effective uid is zero.
.LP
The server will record a diagnostic message in a log file for any
error occurrence.  The log files are maintained in the server_logs
directory below the home directory of the server.
If the log file cannot be opened, the diagnostic message is written
to the system console.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-a active" 15
Specifies if scheduling is active or not.  This sets the server attribute scheduling. If the option argument
is "true" ("True", "t", "T", or "1"), the server is \fBactive\fP and the PBS job scheduler will be called.
If the argument is "false" ("False", "f", "F", or "0), the server is \fBidle\fP, and the scheduler will not be called and no jobs will be run.
If this option is not specified, the server will retain the prior value of the scheduling attribute.
.IP "\-c" 15
Wait 10 minutes before contacting moms. Any mom reporting in does not get pinged
if starting
.B pbs_server
before moms.
.IP "\-d config_path" 15
Specifies the path of the directory which is home to the servers
configuration files, PBS_HOME.  A host may have multiple servers.  Each server
must have a different configuration directory.
The default configuration directory is given by the symbol $PBS_SERVER_HOME
which is typically 
.Ty /usr/spool/PBS .
.IP "\-e" 15
Accept status update from any mom. Adds node to nodes file.
.IP "\-F" 15
Do not fork. Use when running under systemd.
.IP "\-f" 15
Force overwrite of server database.
.IP "\-h" 15
Print help information.
.IP "\-l location"
Specifies where to find the scheduler (for example, Moab) when it does not reside on the same host as Torque.
Example: pbs_server -1 <other_host>:<other_port>
.IP "\-p port" 15
Specifies the port number on which the server will
listen for batch requests.
If multiple servers are running on a
single host, each must have its own unique port number.
This option is for use in testing with multiple batch systems on a single host.
.IP "\-t type"
If the job is rerunnable or restartable, and -t create is specified, the server will discard any existing configuration files, queues, and jobs, and initialize configuration files
to the default values.  The server is idled.
If -t is not specified, job states will remain the same.
.IP "\-v" 15
Shows version.
.IP "\-A acctfile"
Specifies an absolute path name of the file to use as the accounting file.
If not specified, the file is named for the current date in the
PBS_HOME/server_priv/accounting directory.
.IP "\-D"
Debug mode. Do not fork.
.IP "\-H hostname"
Causes the server to start under a different hostname as obtained from
gethostname(2). Useful for servers with multiple network interfaces to support
connections from clients over an interface that has a hostname assigned
that differs from the one that is returned by gethostname(2).
.IP "\-L logfile"
Specifies an absolute path name of the file to use as the log file.
If not specified, the file is one named for the current date in the
PBS_HOME/server_logs directory, see the
.At \-d
option.
.IP "\-M mom_port"
Specifies the host name and/or port number on which the server should connect
the job executor, MOM.  The option argument,
.Ar mom_conn ,
is one of the forms: host_name, [:]port_number, or host_name:port_number.
If host_name not specified, the local host is assumed.   If port_number is not
specified, the default port is assumed.  See the \-M option for pbs_mom(8).
.IP "\-n don't send heirarchy"
Directs pbs_server to not send the hierarchy to all the MOMs on startup. Instead, the hierarchy is only sent if a MOM requests it. This flag works only in conjunction with the local MOM hierarchy feature.
.IP "\-R mom_RPPport"
Specifies the port number on which the the server should query the up/down
status of Mom.    See the \-R option for pbs_mom(8).
.IP "\-S scheduler_port" 15
Specifies the port number to which the server should connect when
contacting the Scheduler.  By default pbs_server looks for the scheduler
on the loopback address at port 15004. The -S option changes the default to the value 
given in the option argument. The option argument,
.Ar scheduler_conn ,
is of the same syntax as under the \-M option.
.IP "\-\-about" 15
Shows information about
.B pbs_server.
.IP "\-\-ha" 15
Enables high availability mode.
.IP "\-\-help" 15
Prints help information.
.IP "\-\-version" 15
Shows version and commit information.
.LP
.SH FILES
.IP $PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_priv 15
default directory for configuration files, typically
/usr/spool/pbs/server_priv
.IP $PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_logs 15
directory for log files recorded by the server.
.SH Signal Handling
On receipt of the following signals, the server performs the defined action:
.IP SIGHUP
The current server log and accounting log are closed and reopened.  This 
allows for the prior log to be renamed and a new log started from the time
of the signal.
.IP SIGINT
Causes an orderly shutdown of pbs_server.
.IP "SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2"
Causes server to increase and decrease logging levels, respectively.
.IP SIGTERM
Causes an orderly shutdown of pbs_server.
.IP SIGSHUTDN
On systems (Unicos) where SIGSHUTDN is defined, it also causes an orderly
shutdown of the server.
.IP "SIGPIPE"
This signal is ignored.
.LP
All other signals have their default behavior installed.
.SH EXIT STATUS
If the server command fails to begin batch operation, the
server exits with a value greater than zero.
