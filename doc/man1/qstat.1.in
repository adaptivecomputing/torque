.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B qstat
command is used to request the status of jobs, queues, or a batch server.
The requested status is written to standard out.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The status is obtained by sending a
.I "Job Status" ,
a
.I "Queue Status" ,
or a
.I "Server Status"
batch request to the appropriate server.
.Ig
.LP
When requesting job status, synopsis format 1 or 2, 
.B qstat
will output information about each 
.Ar job_identifier
or all jobs at each
.Ar destination .
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.SM
The capability to request status of all jobs at a destination is an extension
to POSIX 1003.2d.
.NL
.Ig
Jobs for which the user does not have status privilege are not displayed.
.LP
When requesting queue or server status, synopsis format 3 through 5, qstat
will output information about each
.Ar destination .
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The syntax using the [\-a|-i|-r|-e] line or the \-q line are extensions to POSIX.
.Ig
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-f" 10
Specifies that a full status display be written to standard out.
.IP "\-a" 10
"All" jobs are displayed in the alternative format, see the Standard Output
section.
If the operand is a destination id, all jobs at that destination are displayed.
If the operand is a job id, information about that job is displayed.
.IP "\-e" 10
If the operand is a job id or not specified, only jobs in executable queues are
displayed.  Setting the PBS_QSTAT_EXECONLY environment variable will also enable
this option.
.IP "\-i" 10
Job status is displayed in the alternative format.
For a destination id operand, status for jobs at that destination which are not
running are displayed.  
This includes jobs which are queued, held or waiting.
If an operand is a job id, status for that job is displayed regardless of its
state.
.IP "\-r" 10
If an operand is a job id, status for that job is displayed.
For a destination id operand, status for jobs at that destination which are
running are displayed,  this includes jobs which are suspended.
.IP "\-n" 10
In addition to the basic information, nodes allocated to a job are listed.
.IP "\-1" 10
In combination with \-n, the \-1 option puts all of the nodes on the same line as
the job ID.  In combination with \-f, attributes are not folded to fit in a
terminal window.  This is intended to ease the parsing of the qstat output.
.IP "\-s" 10
In addition to the basic information, any comment provided by the batch
administrator or scheduler is shown.
.IP "\-G" 10
Show size information in giga-bytes.
.IP "\-M" 10
Show size information, disk or memory in mega-words.   A word is considered
to be 8 bytes.
.IP "\-R" 10
In addition to other information, disk reservation information is shown.
Not applicable to all systems.
.IP "\-t" 10
Normal qstat output displays a summary of the array instead of the entire array,
job for job. qstat -t expands the output to display the entire array. Note that
arrays are now named with brackets following the array name; for example:

echo sleep 20 | qsub -t 0-299 189[].pali

Individual jobs in the array are now also noted using square brackets instead of
dashes; for example, here is part of the output of qstat -t for the preceding array:

189[299].napali STDIN[299] dbeer 0 Q batch
.IP "\-u" 10
Job status is displayed in the alternative format.  If an operand is a job id,
status for that job is displayed.  For a destination id operand, status for
jobs at that destination which are owned by the user(s) listed in
.Ar user_list
are displayed.
The syntax of the
.Ar user_list
is:
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ \ user_name[@host][,user_name[@host],...]"
.br
Host names may be wild carded on the left end, e.g. "*.nasa.gov".
User_name without a "@host" is equivalent to "user_name@*", that is at any host.
.IP "\-Q" 10
Specifies that the request is for queue status and that the operands are
destination identifiers.
.IP "\-q" 10
Specifies that the request is for queue status which should be shown in
the alternative format.
.IP "\-B" 10
Specifies that the request is for batch server status and that the operands
are the names of servers.
.IP "\-x" 10
Specifies that the output is to be displayed in XML form.  This option is only
valid with the \-f option or by itself, which will also specify the \-f full status
display.
.IP "\-l" 10
Specifies that the long name of the job (or the job name appended with the suffix alias)
should be displayed.
.LP
.SH  OPERANDS
If neither the
.Ar \-Q
nor the
.Ar \-B
option is given, the operands on the qstat
command must be either job identifiers or destinations identifiers.
.LP
If the operand is a job identifier, it must be in the following form:
.RS 5
.Ty sequence_number[.server_name][@server]
.RE
where
.Ty sequence_number.server_name
is the job identifier assigned at submittal time, see 
.BR qsub .
If the
.Ty .server_name
is omitted, the name of the default server will be used.
If
.Ty @server
is supplied, the request will be for the job identifier currently at that
Server.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
See ERS sections \*(Ji and \*(Di for more details on job identifiers and
batch destinations.
.Ig
.LP
If the operand is a destination identifier, it is one of the following
three forms:
.RS 5
.Ty queue
.br
.Ty @server
.br
.Ty queue@server
.RE
If 
.Ty queue
is specified, the request is for status of all jobs in that queue at the
default server.  If the
.Ty @server
form is given, the request is for status of all jobs at that server.
If a full destination identifier,
.Ty queue@server ,
is given, the request is for status of all jobs in the named queue at the
named server.
.LP
If the
.Ar \-Q
option is given, the operands are destination identifiers as specified
above.  If 
.Ty queue
is specified, the status of that queue at the default server will be given.
If
.Ty queue@server
is specified, the status of the named queue at the named server will be given.
If
.Ty @server
is specified, the status of all queues at
the named server will be given.
If no destination is specified, the status of all queues at the default
server will be given.
.LP
If the
.Ar \-B
option is given, the operand is the name of a server.

.SH STANDARD ERROR
The qstat command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for
each error occurrence.
.SH CONFIGURATION
If
.B qstat
is compiled with an option to include a
.B Tcl
interpreter, using the
.Ar \-f
flag to get a full display causes a check to be made for a script file
to use to output the requested information.  The first location checked
is $HOME/.qstatrc.  If this does not exist, the next location
checked is administrator configured.  If one of these is found, a
.B Tcl
interpreter is started and the script file is passed to it along
with three global variables.  The command line arguments
are split into two variable named
.B flags
and
.B operands .
The status information is passed in a variable named
.B objects .
All of these variables are
.B Tcl
lists.
The
.B flags
list contains the name of the command (usually "qstat") as its first
element.  Any other elements are command line option flags with any
options they use, presented in the order given on the command line.
They are broken up individually so that if two flags are given
together on the command line, they are separated in the list.
For example, if the user typed
.LP
.Ty "qstat \-QfWbigdisplay"
.LP
the
.B flags
list would contain
.LP
.Ty "qstat \-Q \-f \-W bigdisplay"
.LP
The
.B operands
list contains all other command line arguments following the flags.
There will always be at least one element in
.B operands
because if no operands are typed by the user, the default destination
or server name is used.  The
.B objects
list contains all the information retrieved from the server(s)
so the Tcl interpreter can run once to format the entire output.
This list has the same number of elements as the
.B operands
list.  Each element is another list with two elements.  The first
element is a string giving the type of objects to be found in the
second.  The string can take the values
"server", "queue", "job" or "error".  The second element will be a
list in which each element is a single batch status object of the type given
by the string discussed above.  In the case of "error", the list
will be empty.  Each object is again a list.
The first element is the name of the object.  The second is a list
of attributes.  The third element will be the object text.
All three of these object elements correspond with fields in the structure
.Ty batch_status
which is described in detail for each type of object by the man pages for
.B pbs_statjob(3), pbs_statque(3), and pbs_statserver(3).
Each attribute in the second element
list whose elements correspond with the
.Ty attrl
structure.  Each will be a list with two elements.  The first will be
the attribute name and the second will be the attribute value.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
qstat command, the exit status will be a value of zero.
.LP
If the qstat command fails to process any operand, the
command exits with a value greater than zero.
