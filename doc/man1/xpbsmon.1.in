.SH NAME
xpbsmon \- GUI for displaying, monitoring the nodes/execution hosts under PBS
.SH SYNOPSIS
xpbsmon
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBxpbsmon\fP command provides a way to graphically display the various
nodes that run jobs. A node or execution host can be running a \fBpbs_mom\fP
daemon, or not running the daemon. For the latter case, it could just
be a nodename that appears in a nodes file that is managed by a main
\fBpbs_server \fP running on another host. This utility also provides the
ability to monitor values of certain system resources by posting queries
to the \fBpbs_mom\fP of a node.  With this utility, you can see what
job is running on what node, who owns the job, how many nodes assigned to
a job, status of each node (color-coded and the colors are user-modifiable),
how many nodes are available, free, down, reserved, offline, of unknown
status,  in use running multiple jobs or executing only 1 job.
Please see the sections below for a tour and tutorials of xpbsmon. Also, within
every dialog box, a \fBHelp\fP button can be found for assistance.
.SH GETTING STARTED
Running  xpbsmon will initialize the X resource database from various sources
in the following order:
.IP "1."
The \fBRESOURCE_MANAGER\fP property on the root window (updated via xrdb) with
settings usually defined in the .Xdefaults file
.IP "2."
Preference settings defined by the system administrator in the global xpbsmonrc
file
.IP "3."
User's ~/.xpbsmonrc file \- this file defines various X resources like fonts,
colors, list of colors to use to represent the various status of the nodes,
list of PBS sites to query, list of server hosts on each site, list of
nodes/execution hosts on each server host, list of system resource queries to
send to the nodes' pbs_mom, and various view states. See PREFERENCES section
below for a list of resources that can be set.
.SH RUNNING XPBSMON
.LP
\fBxpbsmon\fP can be run either as a regular user or superuser.  If you
run it with less privilege, you may not be able to see all the information for
a node. If it is executed as a regular user, you should still be able to see
what jobs are running on what nodes, possibly state and properties as these
information are obtained by xpbsmon talking directly to the specified server. If
you want other system resource values, it may require special privilege since
xpbsmon will have to talk directly to the pbs_mom of a node. In addition, the
host where xpbsmon was running must also have been given explicit access
permission by the mom (unless the GUI is running on the same host where mom is
running). This is done done by updating the $clienthost and/or the $restricted parameter on the mom's configuration file.

To run \fBxpbsmon\fP, type:
.RS
.sp
.Ty "\ \ \ setenv DISPLAY <display_host>:0"
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ xpbsmon"
.sp
.RE
If you are running the GUI and only interested in jobs data, then be sure to
set all the nodes' type to NOMOM in the \fBPref\fP  dialog box.
.SH THE XPBSMON DISPLAY
This section describes the main parts of the \fBxpbsmon\fP display. The main
window is composed of 3 distinct areas (subwindows) arranged vertically (one
on top of another)  in  the following order:
.RS
\ \ \ 1) Menu
.br
\ \ \ 2) Site Information
.br
\ \ \ 3) Info
.br
.RE
.LP
\fBMenu\fP. The Menu area is composed of a row of command buttons that 
signal some action with a click of the left mouse button. The buttons 
are:
.RS
.IP "Site.." 15
 displays a popup menu containing the list of PBS sites that have been added
using the Sites Preferences window. Simply drag your mouse and release to the
site name whose servers/nodes information you would like to see.
.IP "Pref.." 15
brings up various dialog boxes for specifying the list of sites, servers
on each site, nodes that are known to a server, and the system resource
queries to be sent to a node's pbs_mom daemon.
.IP "Auto Update.." 15
brings up another window for specifying whether or not to do auto updates of
nodes information, and also for specifying the interval number
of minutes between updates.
.IP "Help" 15
contains some help information.
.IP "About" 15
tells who the author is and who to send comments, bugs, suggestions to.
.IP "Close" 15
for exiting \fBxpbsmon\fP plus saving the current setup information
(if anything had changed) in the user's $HOME/.xpbsmonrc file. Information
saved include the specified list of sites, servers on each site, nodes
known to each server, and system resource queries to send to node's pbs_mom.
.IP "Minimize Button" 15
shows the iconized view of Site Information where nodes are represented
as tiny boxes, where each box is colored according to status. In order to get
more information about a node, you need to double click on the colored box.
.IP "Maximize button" 15
shows the full view of Site Information where nodes are represented in bigger
boxes, still colored depending on the status, and some information on it is
displayed.
.RE
.LP
\fBSite Information\fP. 
Only one site at a time can be displayed. This area (shown as one huge box
referred to as the site box) can be further sub-divided into 3 areas: the site
name label at the top, server boxes in the middle, and the color status bar at
the bottom.  The site name label shows the name of the site as specified in the
\fBPref..\fP window.  At the middle of the site box shows a row of big boxes
housing smaller boxes.
.sp
The big box is an abstraction of a server host (called a server box),
showing its server display label at the top of the box, a grid of smaller boxes
representing the nodes that the server knows about (where jobs are run), and
summary status for the nodes under the server. Status information will show
counters for the number of nodes used, available, reserved, offline, or of
unknown status and even # of cpus assigned.  For a cleaner display, some
counters with a value of zero are not displayed.
The server boxes are placed in a grid, with a new row being started
when either *siteBoxMaxNumServerBoxesPerRow or *siteBoxMaxWidth limit has been
reached.
.sp
The smaller boxes represent the nodes/execution hosts where jobs are run
(referred to as node boxes).  Each node box shows the name at the top, and a
sub-box (a smaller square) that is is colored according to the status of the
node that it represents, and if the view type is FULL, it will will display
some node information according to the system resource queries specified on
the \fBPref..\fP window.  Clicking on the sub-box will show a much bigger box
(called the MIRROR view) with bigger fonts containing nodes information. Another
view is called ICON and this shows a tiny box with a colored area. The
node boxes are arranged in a grid, where a new row is created if either the
*serverBoxMaxNumNodeBoxesPerRow or *serverBoxMaxWidth limit has been reached.
ICON view of the node boxes will be constrained by the *nodeBoxIconMaxHeight
and *nodeBoxIconMaxWidth pixel values; FULL view of the node boxes will be
bounded by *nodeBoxFullMaxWidth and *nodeBoxFullMaxHeight; the mirror
view of the node boxes has its size be *nodeBoxMirrorMaxWidth, and
*nodeBoxMirrorMaxHeight.
.sp
Horizontal and vertical scrollbars for the site box, server box, and
node box will be displayed as needed. 
.sp
Finally, the color bar information shows a color chart displaying what the
various colors mean in terms of node status. The color-to-status mapping can be
modified by setting the X resources: *nodeColorNOINFO, *nodeColorFREE,
*nodeColorINUSEshared, *nodeColorINUSEexclusive, *nodeColorDOWN, *nodeColorRSVD,
*nodeColorOFFL.
.sp
.LP
\fBInfo\fP. The Info Area shows the progress of some of the background
actions performed by \fBxpbsmon\fP. Look into this box for errors.
.SH WIDGETS USED IN XPBSMON
Some of the widgets used in \fBxpbsmon\fP and how they are manipulated are
described in the following:
.sp
.IP "1." 3
\fBlistbox\fP \- the ones found in this GUI are only single-selectable
(one  entry  can be highlighted/selected at a time via a mouse click).
.IP "2." 3
\fBscrollbar\fP \- usually appears either vertically or
horizontally and contains 5 distinct areas that are mouse
clicked to achieve different effects:
.RS
.IP "top arrow" 14
Causes the view in the associated widget to shift up
by one unit (i.e. the object appears to move down
one unit in its window). If the button is held down
the action will auto-repeat.
.IP "top gap" 14
Causes the view in the associated window to shift up
by one less than the number of units in the window
(i.e. the portion of the object that used to appear
at the very top of the window will  now  appear at
the  very bottom).  If the button is held down the
action will auto-repeat.
.IP "slider" 14
Pressing button 1 in this area has  no immediate
effect except to  cause the slider to appear  sunken
rather than raised.  However, if the mouse is moved
with the button down  then  the slider will  be
dragged, adjusting the view as the mouse is moved.
.IP "bottom gap" 14
Causes the view in the associated window to shift
down  by one less  than the number of units in the
window (i.e.  the portion of  the  object  that  used
to appear at the very bottom of the window will  now
appear  at the very top).  If the button is held down
the action  will auto-repeat.
.IP "bottom arrow" 14
Causes the view in the associated window to shift
down by one unit (i.e. the object appears to move up
one unit in its window). If the button is held down
the action will auto-repeat.
.RE
.sp
.IP "3." 3
\fBentry\fP \- brought into focus with a click of the left
mouse button.  To manipulate this widget, simply type in
the text value. Use of arrow keys, mouse selection of
text for deletion or overwrite, copying and pasting with
sole use of mouse buttons are permitted.
This widget is usually accompanied by a scrollbar for
horizontally scanning a long text entry string.
.sp
.IP "4." 3
\fBbox\fP \-  made up of 1 or more listboxes displayed adjacent
to each other giving the effect of a "matrix". Each row
from the listboxes makes up an element of the box. In order
to add items to the box, you need to manipulate the accompanying
entry widgets, one for each listbox, and then clicking the \fBadd\fP
button. Removing items from the box is done by selecting an
element, and then clicking \fBdelete\fP.
.sp
.IP "5." 3
\fBspinbox\fP \- a combination of an entry widget and a
horizontal scrollbar.  The entry widget will only accept
values that fall within a defined list of valid values, and
incrementing through the valid values is done by clicking on
the up/down arrows.
.IP "6." 3
\fBbutton\fP \- a rectangular region appearing either raised or
pressed that invokes an action when clicked with the left
mouse button.  When the button appears pressed, then hitting
the <RETURN> key will automatically select the button.
.SH UPDATING PREFERENCES
.IP "CASE 1: Time Sharing"
.sp
Suppose you have a time-sharing environment where the front-end is
called bower and you have 4 nodes: bower1, bower2, bower3, bower4.
bower is the host that runs the server; jobs are submitted to host bower where
it enqueues it for future execution. Also, a pbs_mom daemon is running on
each of the execution hosts. If the server bower also maintains a nodes list
containing information like state, properties for the 4 nodes, then this will
also be reported. Then to setup \fBxpbsmon\fP, do the following:
.sp
.RS
.IP 1.
Click the \fBPref..\fP button on the Menu section.
.IP 2.
On the Sites Preference dialog, enter any arbitrary site name, for example
"Local". Then click the \fBadd\fP button.
.IP 3.
On the Server_Host entry box, enter "bower", and on the DisplayLabel entry
box, put an arbitrary label (as it would appear on the header of the server
box) like "Bower", and then click \fBadd\fP.
.IP 4.
Click the \fBnodes..\fP button that is accompanying the Servers box.
This would bring up the Server Preference dialog.
.IP 5.
Now add the entries "bower1", "bower2", "bower3", "bower4" specifying type MOM
for each on the Nodes box.
.IP 6.
If you need to monitor certain system resource parameters for each of
the nodes, you need to specify query expressions containing resource
queries to be sent to the individual PBS moms. For example, if you
want to obtain memory usage, then select a node from the Nodes list,
click on the \fBquery..\fP button that accompanies the Nodes list, and
this would bring up the Query Table dialog. Specify the following input:
.sp
.RS
Query_Expr:    (availmem/totmem) * 100
.br
Display_Info:  Memory Usage:
.br
Display_Type:  SCALE
.RE
.IP
.sp
The above says to display the result of the "Query_Expr" in a scale
widget calibrated over 100. The queries "availmem" and "totmem" will
be sent to the PBS mom, and the expression is evaluated upon receiving
all results from the mom. If you want to display the result of
another query, say "loadave", directly, then specify the following:
.sp
.RS
Query_Expr:    loadave
.br
Display_Info:  Load Average:
.br
Display_Type:  TEXT
.RE
.IP
.sp
NOTE: For a list of queries that can be sent to a pbs_mom, please
click on the \fBHelp\fP button on the Query table window.
.RE
.IP "CASE 2: Jobs Exclusive Environment"
Supposing you have a "space non-sharing" environment where the server
maintains a list of nodes that it runs jobs on exclusively (one job at a time
outstanding per node). Let's call this server b1. Simply update Preferences
information as follows:
.RS
.IP 1.
Click the \fBPref..\fP button on the Menu section.
.IP 2.
On the Sites Preference dialog, enter a site name, for example
"B System". Then click the \fBadd\fP button.
.IP 3.
On the Server_Host entry box, enter "b1", DisplayLabel entry box type "B1" (or
whatever label that you would like to appear on the header of the server box),
and then click \fBadd\fP.
.sp
.RE
.IP "CASE 3: Hybrid Time Sharing/Space Sharing Environment"
A cluster of heterogeneous machines, time-sharing or jobs exclusive,  could
easily be represented in \fBxpbsmon\fP by combining steps in CASE 1 and CASE 2.
.SH LEAVING XPBSMON
Click on the \fBClose\fP button located in the Menu bar to leave \fBxpbsmon\fP.
If anything had changed, it will bring up a  dialog box  asking  for a
confirmation in regards to saving preferences information about list of sites,
their view types, list of servers on each site, the list of nodes known to each
server, and the list of queries to be sent to the pbs_mom of each node.  The
information  is saved in ~/.xpbsmonrc file.
