.SH DESCRIPTION
To create a job is to submit an executable script to a batch server.
The batch server will be the default server unless the
.Ar \-q
option is specified.  See discussion of PBS_DEFAULT under Environment Variables
below.
Typically, the script is a shell script which will be executed
by a command shell such as sh or csh.
.LP
Options on the
.B qsub
command allow the specification of attributes which affect the behavior
of the job.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The job is created by sending a 
.I "Queue Job"
batch request to the batch server.
.Ig
.LP
The qsub
command will pass certain environment variables in the
.At Variable_List
attribute of the job.
These variables will be available to the job.
The value for the following variables will be taken from the environment
of the qsub
command: \fBHOME\fP, \fBLANG\fP, \fBLOGNAME\fP, \fBPATH\fP, \fBMAIL\fP,
\fBSHELL\fP,
and \fBTZ\fP.  These values will be assigned to a new name which is the
current name prefixed with the string "PBS_O_".
For example, the job will have access to an environment variable named
.B PBS_O_HOME
which have the value of the variable
.B HOME
in the qsub command environment.
.LP
In addition to the above, the following environment variables will be available
to the batch job.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
(The values of the following environment variables are established by qsub.)
.Ig
.IP \fBPBS_O_HOST\fP
the name of the host upon which the qsub command is running.
.IP \fBPBS_SERVER\fP
the hostname of the pbs_server which qsub submits the job to.
.IP \fBPBS_O_QUEUE\fP
the name of the original queue to which the job was submitted.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
(It is established by the server which creates the job, not qsub.)
.Ig
.IP \fBPBS_O_WORKDIR\fP
the absolute path of the current working directory of the qsub command.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
.LP
The following are established by the server executing the job,
not the qsub command.
.Ig
.IP \fBPBS_ARRAYID\fP
each member of a job array is assigned a unique identifier (see \-t)
.IP \fBPBS_ENVIRONMENT\fP
set to 
.Ty PBS_BATCH
to indicate the job is a batch job, or to
.Ty PBS_INTERACTIVE
to indicate the job is a PBS interactive job, see \-I option.
.IP \fBPBS_JOBID\fP
the job identifier assigned to the job by the batch system.
.IP \fBPBS_JOBNAME\fP
the job name supplied by the user.
.IP \fBPBS_NODEFILE\fP
the name of the file contain the list of nodes assigned to the job
(for parallel and cluster systems).
.IP \fBPBS_QUEUE\fP
the name of the queue from which the job is executed.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-a date_time" 8
Declares the time after which the job is eligible for execution.
.RS
.LP
The
.Ar date_time
argument is in the form: 
.Ty "[[[[CC]YY]MM]DD]hhmm[.SS]"
.LP
Where CC is the first two digits of the year (the century),
YY is the second two digits of the year, MM is the two digits for the month,
DD is the day of the month, hh is the hour, mm is the minute,
and the optional SS is the seconds.
.LP
If the month,
.Ty MM ,
is not specified, it will default to the current month if the specified day
.Ty DD ,
is in the future.  Otherwise, the month will be set to next month.
Likewise, if the day,
.Ty DD ,
is not specified, it will default to today if the time
.Ty hhmm
is in the future.  Otherwise, the day will be set to tomorrow.
For example, if you submit a job at 11:15am with a time of 
.Ty "\-a 1110" ,
the job will be eligible to run at 11:10am tomorrow.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
See the date_time operand for the touch(1) command defined by POSIX.2.
.LP
The 
.At Execution_Time
job attribute will be set to the number of seconds since Epoch which
is equivalent to the Universal time expressed by the local time in the
.Ar date_time
argument.
If the 
.Ar \-a
option is not specified, the
.At Execution_Time
attribute is unset which represents a time zero or no delay.
.Ig
.RE
.IP "\-A account_string" 8
Defines the account string associated with the job.
The
.Ar account_string
is an undefined string of characters and is interpreted by the server
which executes the job.  See section 2.7.1 of the PBS ERS.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The
.At Account_Name
attribute is set to the account string.
If account_string is unset, it is not passed with the job to the job executor.
.Ig
.IP "\-b seconds"
Defines the maximum number of seconds qsub will block attempting to contact
pbs_server.  If pbs_server is down, or for a variety of communication failures,
qsub will continually retry connecting to pbs_server for job submission.  This
value overrides the 
.B CLIENTRETRY
parameter in 
.B torque.cfg.
This is a non-portable TORQUE extension.  Portability-minded users can use the
.B PBS_CLIENTRETRY
environmental variable.  A negative value is
interpreted as infinity.  The default is 0.
.IP "\-c checkpoint_options"
Defines the options that will apply to the job.  If the job
executes upon a host which does not support checkpoint, these options will
be ignored.
.IP
Valid checkpoint options are:
.RS

Specify that periodic checkpointing is enabled. The default interval is 10 minutes and can be changed by the $checkpoint_interval option in the mom config file or by specifying an interval when the job is submitted
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The job's
.At Checkpoint
attribute is set to the string
.Ty """periodic""" .
.Ig
.IP interval=minutes 3
Checkpointing is to be performed at an interval of
.Ar minutes ,
which is the integer number of minutes of wall time used by the job.
This value must be greater than zero.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The
.At Checkpoint
attribute is set to the string specified by
.Ar """interval=minutes""" .
.Ig
.IP depth=number 3
Specify a number (depth) of checkpoint images to be kept in the checkpoint directory.

.RE
.IP "\-C directive_prefix" 8
Defines the prefix that declares a directive to the qsub command within the
script file.  See the paragraph on script directives in the
Extended Description section.
.IP
If the
.Ar \-C
option is presented with a
.Ar directive_prefix
argument that is the null string, qsub
will not scan the script file for directives.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The directive prefix is not a job attribute.  It is used solely within the
qsub command.
.Ig
.IP "\-d path" 8
Defines the working directory path to be used for the job.  If the
.Ar \-d
option is not specified, the default working directory is the home directory.
This option sets the environment variable PBS_O_INITDIR.
.Ig
.IP "\-D path" 8
Defines the root directory to be used for the job.
This option sets the environment variable PBS_O_ROOTDIR.
.Ig
.IP "\-e path" 8
Defines the path to be used for the standard error stream of the batch job.
The
.Ar path
argument is of the form:
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ \ [hostname:][path_name]"
.br
where 
.Ty hostname
is the name of a host to which the file will be returned and
.Ty path_name
is the path
name on that host in the syntax recognized by POSIX.
The argument will be interpreted as follows:
.RS
.IP \fBpath_name\fP
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the qsub command will
expand the path name relative to the current working directory of the command.
The command will supply the name of the host upon which it is executing for the
.Ar hostname
component.
.IP \fBhostname:path_name\fP
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the qsub command will not
expand the path name relative to the current working directory of the command.
On delivery of the standard error, the path name will be expanded relative
to the user's home directory on the \fBhostname\fP system.
.IP \fBpath_name\fP
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, then the qsub will supply
the name of the host on which it is executing for the
.Ar hostname
.IP \fBhostname:path_name\fP
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, the path will be used as
specified.
.Ar hostname .
.IP \fBhostname:\fP
Where hostname specifies the name of the host that the file should be returned
to. The path will be the default file name.
.RE
.IP
If the
.Ar \-e
option is not specified or the \fBpath_name\fP is not specified or is specified
and is a directory, the default file name for the standard error stream
will be used.  The default name has the following form:
.br
\ \ \ \ \fBjob_name.esequence_number\fP
.br
where \fBjob_name\fP is the name of the job, see
.Ar \-N 
option, and \fBsequence_number\fP is the job number assigned when the
job is submitted.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
This option sets the job attribute
.At Error_Path .
.Ig
.IP "\-f" 8
Specifies that the job is fault tolerant. The

attribute will be set to true, which indicates that the job can 
survive the loss of a mom other than the "mother superior" mom
(the first node in the exec hosts )
.Ig
.IP "\-h" 8
Specifies that a user hold be applied to the job at submission time.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig
The
.At Hold_Types
attribute will be set to USER, "u".
If \-h is not specified, then
.At Hold_Types 
is set to NONE, "n".
.Ig
.IP "\-I" 8
Declares that the job is to be run "interactively".  The job will be queued
and scheduled as any PBS batch job, but when executed, the standard input,
output, and error streams of the job are connected through qsub to the
terminal session in which qsub is running.  Interactive jobs are forced
to not rerunable.
See the "Extended Description" paragraph for addition information of 
interactive jobs.
.if !\n(Pb .ig Ig

Script Processing:
.LP
A job script may consist of PBS directives, comments and executable statements.
A PBS directive provides a way of specifying job attributes in addition to
the command line options.
For example:
.RS
.Cs
.Ty ":"
.Ty "#PBS \-N Job_name"
.Ty "#PBS \-l walltime=10:30,mem=320kb"
.Ty "#PBS \-m be"
.Ty "#"
.Ty "step1 arg1 arg2"
.Ty "step2 arg3 arg4"
.Ce
.RE
.LP
The qsub
command scans the lines of the script file for directives.
An initial line in the script that begins with the characters "#!" or the
character ":" will be ignored and scanning will start with the next line.
Scanning will continue until the first executable line, that is a line that
is not blank, not a directive line, nor a line whose first non white space
character is "#".
If directives occur on subsequent lines, they will be ignored.
.LP
A line in the script file will be processed as a directive to qsub
if and only if the string of characters starting with the first non white
space character on the line and of the same length as the directive prefix
matches the directive prefix.
.LP
The remainder of the directive line consists of the options to qsub
in the same syntax as they appear on the command line.
The option character is to be preceded with the "\-" character.
.LP
If an option is present in both a directive and on the command line, that
option and its argument, if any, will be ignored in the directive.  The
command line takes precedence.
.LP
If an option is present in a directive and not on the command line, that
option and its argument, if any, will be processed as if it had occurred
on the command line.
.LP
The directive prefix string will be determined in order of preference
from:
.RS 4
.sp
The value of the
.Ar \-C
option argument if the option is specified on the command line.
.sp
The value of the environment variable
.B PBS_DPREFIX 
if it is defined.
.sp
The four character string
.Ty #PBS .

.RE
If the
.Ar \-C
option is found in a directive in the script file, it will be ignored.

User Authorization:
.LP
When the user submits a job from a system other than the one on which the
PBS Server is running, the name under which the job is to be executed is
selected according to the rules listed under the \-u option.
The user submitting the job must be authorized to run the job under the
execution user name. 
This authorization is provided if 
.RS
.IP (1) 5
The host on which qsub is run is trusted by the execution host (see
/etc/hosts.equiv),
.IP (2)
The execution user has an .rhosts file naming the submitting user on the
submitting host.
.RE
.LP
C-Shell .logout File:
.LP
The following warning applies for users of the c-shell, csh.
If the job is executed under the csh and a 
.I .logout
file exists in the home directory in which the job executes,
the exit status of the job is that of the .logout script, not the job script.
This may impact any inter-job dependencies.
To preserve the job exit status, either remove the .logout file or place the
following line as the first line in the .logout file
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ set EXITVAL = $status"
.br
and the following line as the last executable line in .logout
.br
.Ty "\ \ \ exit $EXITVAL"
.LP
Interactive Jobs:
.LP
If the 
.Ar \-I 
option is specified on the command line or in a script directive, or if
the "interactive" job attribute declared true via the \-W option,
.Ty "\-W interactive=true" ,
either on the command line or in a script directive, the job is an interactive
job.  The script will be processed for directives, but will not be included
with the job.  When the job begins execution, all input to the job is from
the terminal session in which qsub is running.
.LP
When an interactive job is submitted, the qsub command will not
terminate when the job is submitted.  Qsub will remain running until the
job terminates, is aborted, or the user interrupts qsub with an SIGINT
(the control-C key).  If qsub is interrupted prior to job start,
it will query if the user wishes to exit.
If the user response "yes", qsub exits and the job is aborted.
.LP
Once the interactive job has started execution, input to and output from the
job pass through qsub.  Keyboard generated interrupts are passed to the job.
Lines entered that begin with the tilde ('~') character and contain special
sequences are escaped by qsub.  The recognized escape sequences are:
.RS
.IP "~."
Qsub terminates execution.  The batch job is also terminated.
.IP "~susp"
Suspend the qsub program if running under the C shell.  "susp" is the suspend
character, usually CNTL-Z.
.IP "~asusp"
Suspend the input half of qsub (terminal to job), but allow output to continue
to be displayed.  Only works under the C shell.  "asusp" is the auxiliary
suspend character, usually CNTL-Y.
.RE
.LP
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing, the qsub exit status will be a value of zero.
